FIELD OF THE INVENTION    The present invention relates to antigen binding proteins that bind to proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) and methods of using and making the antigen binding proteins.    BACKGROUND OF VARIOUS EMBODIMENTS    Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a serine protease involved in regulating the levels of the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) protein (Horton et al., 2007; Seidah and Prat, 2007). In vitro experiments have shown that adding PCSK9 to HepG2 cells lowers the levels of cell surface LDLR (Benjannet et al., 2004; Lagace et al., 2006; Maxwell et al., 2005; Park et al., 2004). Experiments with mice have shown that increasing PCSK9 protein levels decreases levels of LDLR protein in the liver (Benjannet et al., 2004; Lagace et al., 2006; Maxwell et al., 2005; Park et al., 2004), while PCSK9 knockout mice have increased levels of LDLR in the liver (Rashid et al., 2005). Additionally, various human PCSK9 mutations that result in either increased or decreased levels of plasma LDL have been identified (Kotowski et al., 2006; Zhao et al., 2006). PCSK9 has been shown to directly interact with the LDLR protein, be endocytosed along with the LDLR, and co-immunofluoresce with the LDLR throughout the endosomal pathway (Lagace et al., 2006). Degradation of the LDLR by PCSK9 has not been observed and the mechanism through which it lowers extracellular LDLR protein levels is uncertain.    PCSK9 is a prohormone-proprotein convertase in the subtilisin (S8) family of serine proteases (Seidah et al., 2003). Humans have nine prohormone-proprotein convertases that can be divided between the S8A and S8B subfamilies (Rawlings et al., 2006). Furin, PC1/PC3, PC2, PACE4, PC4, PC5/PC6 and PC7/PC8/LPC/SPC7 are classified in subfamily S8B. Crystal and NMR structures of different domains from mouse furin and PC1 reveal subtilisin-like pro- and catalytic domains, and a P domain directly C-terminal to the catalytic domain (Henrich et al., 2003; Tangrea et al., 2002). Based on the amino acid sequence similarity within this subfamily, all seven members are predicted to have similar structures (Henrich et al., 2005). SKI-1/S1P and PCSK9 are classified in subfamily S8A. Sequence comparisons with these proteins also suggest the presence of subtilisin-like pro- and catalytic domains (Sakai et al., 1998; Seidah et al., 2003; Seidah et al., 1999). In these proteins the amino acid sequence C-terminal to the catalytic domain is more variable and does not suggest the presence of a P domain.    Prohormone-proprotein convertases are expressed as zymogens and they mature through a multi step process. The function of the pro-domain in this process is two-fold. The pro-domain first acts as a chaperone and is required for proper folding of the catalytic domain (Ikemura et al., 1987). Once the catalytic domain is folded, autocatalysis occurs between the pro-domain and catalytic domain. Following this initial cleavage reaction, the pro-domain remains bound to the catalytic domain where it then acts as an inhibitor of catalytic activity (Fu et al., 2000). When conditions are correct, maturation proceeds with a second autocatalytic event at a site within the pro-domain (Anderson et al., 1997). After this second cleavage event occurs the pro-domain and catalytic domain dissociate, giving rise to an active protease.    Autocatalysis of the PCSK9 zymogen occurs between Gln152 and Ser153 (VFAQ|SIP) (Naureckiene et al., 2003), and has been shown to be required for its secretion from cells (Seidah et al., 2003). A second autocatalytic event at a site within PCSK9's pro-domain has not been observed. Purified PCSK9 is made up of two species that can be separated by non-reducing SDS-PAGE; the pro-domain at 17 Kd, and the catalytic plus C-terminal domains at 65 Kd. PCSK9 has not been isolated without its inhibitory pro-domain, and measurements of PCSK9's catalytic activity have been variable (Naureckiene et al., 2003; Seidah et al., 2003).

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS    Antigen binding proteins (such as antibodies and functional binding fragments thereof) that bind to PCSK9 are disclosed herein. In some embodiments, the antigen binding proteins bind to PCSK9 and prevent PCSK9 from functioning in various ways. In some embodiments, the antigen binding proteins block or reduce the ability of PCSK9 to interact with other substances. For example, in some embodiments, the antigen binding protein binds to PCSK9 in a manner that prevents or reduces the likelihood that PCSK9 will bind to LDLR. In other embodiments, antigen binding proteins bind to PCSK9 but do not block PCSK9's ability to interact with LDLR. In some embodiments, the antigen binding proteins are human monoclonal antibodies.    As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, in light of the present disclosure, altering the interactions between PCSK9 and LDLR can increase the amount of LDLR available for binding to LDL, which in turn decreases the amount of serum LDL in a subject, resulting in a reduction in the subject's serum cholesterol level. As such, antigen binding proteins to PCSK9 can be used in various methods and compositions for treating subjects with elevated serum cholesterol levels, at risk of elevated serum cholesterol levels, or which could benefit from a reduction in their serum cholesterol levels. Thus, various methods and techniques for lowering, maintaining, or preventing an increase in serum cholesterol are also described herein. In some embodiments, the antigen binding protein allows for binding between PCSK9 and LDLR, but the antigen binding protein prevents or reduces the adverse activity of PCSK9 on LDLR. In some embodiments, the antigen binding protein prevents or reduces the binding of PCSK9 to LDLR.    For convenience, the following sections generally outline the various meanings of the terms used herein. Following this discussion, general aspects regarding antigen binding proteins are discussed, followed by specific examples demonstrating the properties of various embodiments of the antigen binding proteins and how they can be employed.    Definitions and Embodiments    It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the invention as claimed. In this application, the use of the singular includes the plural unless specifically stated otherwise. In this application, the use of 'or' means 'and/or' unless stated otherwise. Furthermore, the use of the term 'including', as well as other forms, such as 'includes' and 'included', is not limiting. Also, terms such as 'element' or 'component' encompass both elements and components comprising one unit and elements and components that comprise more than one subunit unless specifically stated otherwise. Also, the use of the term 'portion' can include part of a moiety or the entire moiety.    The section headings used herein are for organizational purposes only and are not to be construed as limiting the subject matter described. All documents, or portions of documents, cited in this application, including but not limited to patents, patent applications, articles, books, and treatises, are hereby expressly incorporated by reference in their entirety for any purpose. As utilized in accordance with the present disclosure, the following terms, unless otherwise indicated, shall be understood to have the following meanings:    The term 'proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9' or 'PCSK9' refers to a polypeptide as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 1 and/or 3 or fragments thereof, as well as related polypeptides, which include, but are not limited to, allelic variants, splice variants, derivative variants, substitution variants, deletion variants, and/or insertion variants including the addition of an N-terminal methionine, fusion polypeptides, and interspecies homologs. In certain embodiments, a PCSK9 polypeptide includes terminal residues, such as, but not limited to, leader sequence residues, targeting residues, amino terminal methionine residues, lysine residues, tag residues and/or fusion protein residues. 'PCSK9' has also been referred to as FH3, NARC1, HCHOLA3, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9, and neural apoptosis regulated convertase 1. The PCSK9 gene encodes a proprotein convertase protein that belongs to the proteinase K subfamily of the secretory subtilase family. The term 'PCSK9' denotes both the proprotein and the product generated following autocatalysis of the proprotein. When only the autocatalyzed product is being referred to (such as for an antigen binding protein that selectively binds to the cleaved PCSK9), the protein can be referred to as the 'mature,' 'cleaved', 'processed' or 'active' PCSK9. When only the inactive form is being referred to, the protein can be referred to as the 'inactive', 'pro-form', or 'unprocessed' form of PCSK9. The term PCSK9 as used herein also includes naturally occurring alleles, such as the mutations D374Y, S127R and F216L. The term PCSK9 also encompasses PCSK9 molecules incorporating post-translational modifications of the PCSK9 amino acid sequence, such as PCSK9 sequences that have been glycosylated, PEGylated, PCSK9 sequences from which its signal sequence has been cleaved, PCSK9 sequence from which its pro domain has been cleaved from the catalytic domain but not separated from the catalytic domain (e.g., FIGS. 1A and 1B).    The term 'PCSK9 activity' includes any biological effect of PCSK9. In certain embodiments, PCSK9 activity includes the ability of PCSK9 to interact or bind to a substrate or receptor. In some embodiments, PCSK9 activity is represented by the ability of PCSK9 to bind to a LDL receptor (LDLR). In some embodiments, PCSK9 binds to and catalyzes a reaction involving LDLR. In some embodiments, PCSK9 activity includes the ability of PCSK9 to alter (e.g., reduce) the availability of LDLR. In some embodiments, PCSK9 activity includes the ability of PCSK9 to increase the amount of LDL in a subject. In some embodiments, PCSK9 activity includes the ability of PCSK9 to decrease the amount of LDLR that is available to bind to LDL. In some embodiments, 'PCSK9 activity' includes any biological activity resulting from PCSK9 signaling. Exemplary activities include, but are not limited to, PCSK9 binding to LDLR, PCSK9 enzyme activity that cleaves LDLR or other proteins, PCSK9 binding to proteins other than LDLR that facilitate PCSK9 action, PCSK9 altering APOB secretion (Sun X-M et al, 'Evidence for effect of mutant PCSK9 on apoliprotein B secretion as the cause of unusually severe dominant hypercholesterolemia, Human Molecular Genetics 14: 1161-1169, 2005 and Ouguerram K et al, 'Apolipoprotein B100 metabolism in autosomal-dominant hypercholesterolemia related to mutations in PCSK9, Arterioscler thromb Vasc Biol. 24: 1448-1453, 2004), PCSK9's role in liver regeneration and neuronal cell differentiation (Seidah N G et al, 'The secretory proprotein convertase neural apoptosis-regulated convertase 1 (NARC-1): Liver regeneration and neuronal differentiation' PNAS 100: 928-933, 2003), and PCSK9s role in hepatic glucose metabolism (Costet et al., 'Hepatic PCSK9 expression is regulated by nutritional status via insulin and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c' J. Biol. Chem. 281(10):6211-18, 2006).    The term 'hypercholesterolemia,' as used herein, refers to a condition in which cholesterol levels are elevated above a desired level. In some embodiments, this denotes that serum cholesterol levels are elevated. In some embodiments, the desired level takes into account various 'risk factors' that are known to one of skill in the art (and are described or referenced herein).    The term 'polynucleotide' or 'nucleic acid' includes both single-stranded and double-stranded nucleotide polymers. The nucleotides comprising the polynucleotide can be ribonucleotides or deoxyribonucleotides or a modified form of either type of nucleotide. Said modifications include base modifications such as bromouridine and inosine derivatives, ribose modifications such as 2',3'-dideoxyribose, and internucleotide linkage modifications such as phosphorothioate, phosphorodithioate, phosphoroselenoate, phosphorodiselenoate, phosphoroanilothioate, phoshoraniladate and phosphoroamidate.    The term 'oligonucleotide' means a polynucleotide comprising 200 or fewer nucleotides. In some embodiments, oligonucleotides are 10 to 60 bases in length. In other embodiments, oligonucleotides are 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20 to 40 nucleotides in length. Oligonucleotides can be single stranded or double stranded, e.g., for use in the construction of a mutant gene. Oligonucleotides can be sense or antisense oligonucleotides. An oligonucleotide can include a label, including a radiolabel, a fluorescent label, a hapten or an antigenic label, for detection assays. Oligonucleotides can be used, for example, as PCR primers, cloning primers or hybridization probes.    An 'isolated nucleic acid molecule' means a DNA or RNA of genomic, mRNA, cDNA, or synthetic origin or some combination thereof which is not associated with all or a portion of a polynucleotide in which the isolated polynucleotide is found in nature, or is linked to a polynucleotide to which it is not linked in nature. For purposes of this disclosure, it should be understood that 'a nucleic acid molecule comprising' a particular nucleotide sequence does not encompass intact chromosomes. Isolated nucleic acid molecules 'comprising' specified nucleic acid sequences can include, in addition to the specified sequences, coding sequences for up to ten or even up to twenty other proteins or portions thereof, or can include operably linked regulatory sequences that control expression of the coding region of the recited nucleic acid sequences, and/or can include vector sequences.    Unless specified otherwise, the left-hand end of any single-stranded polynucleotide sequence discussed herein is the 5' end; the left-hand direction of double-stranded polynucleotide sequences is referred to as the 5' direction. The direction of 5' to 3' addition of nascent RNA transcripts is referred to as the transcription direction; sequence regions on the DNA strand having the same sequence as the RNA transcript that are 5' to the 5' end of the RNA transcript are referred to as 'upstream sequences;' sequence regions on the DNA strand having the same sequence as the RNA transcript that are 3' to the 3' end of the RNA transcript are referred to as 'downstream sequences.'    The term 'control sequence' refers to a polynucleotide sequence that can affect the expression and processing of coding sequences to which it is ligated. The nature of such control sequences can depend upon the host organism. In particular embodiments, control sequences for prokaryotes can include a promoter, a ribosomal binding site, and a transcription termination sequence. For example, control sequences for eukaryotes can include promoters comprising one or a plurality of recognition sites for transcription factors, transcription enhancer sequences, and transcription termination sequence. 'Control sequences' can include leader sequences and/or fusion partner sequences.    The term 'vector' means any molecule or entity (e.g., nucleic acid, plasmid, bacteriophage or virus) used to transfer protein coding information into a host cell.    The term 'expression vector' or 'expression construct' refers to a vector that is suitable for transformation of a host cell and contains nucleic acid sequences that direct and/or control (in conjunction with the host cell) expression of one or more heterologous coding regions operatively linked thereto. An expression construct can include, but is not limited to, sequences that affect or control transcription, translation, and, if introns are present, affect RNA splicing of a coding region operably linked thereto.    As used herein, 'operably linked' means that the components to which the term is applied are in a relationship that allows them to carry out their inherent functions under suitable conditions. For example, a control sequence in a vector that is 'operably linked' to a protein coding sequence is ligated thereto so that expression of the protein coding sequence is achieved under conditions compatible with the transcriptional activity of the control sequences.    The term 'host cell' means a cell that has been transformed, or is capable of being transformed, with a nucleic acid sequence and thereby expresses a gene of interest. The term includes the progeny of the parent cell, whether or not the progeny is identical in morphology or in genetic make-up to the original parent cell, so long as the gene of interest is present.    The term 'transfection' means the uptake of foreign or exogenous DNA by a cell, and a cell has been 'transfected' when the exogenous DNA has been introduced inside the cell membrane. A number of transfection techniques are well known in the art and are disclosed herein. See, e.g., Graham et al., 1973, Virology 52:456; Sambrook et al., 2001, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, supra; Davis et al., 1986, Basic Methods in Molecular Biology, Elsevier; Chu et al., 1981, Gene 13:197. Such techniques can be used to introduce one or more exogenous DNA moieties into suitable host cells.    The term 'transformation' refers to a change in a cell's genetic characteristics, and a cell has been transformed when it has been modified to contain new DNA or RNA. For example, a cell is transformed where it is genetically modified from its native state by introducing new genetic material via transfection, transduction, or other techniques. Following transfection or transduction, the transforming DNA can recombine with that of the cell by physically integrating into a chromosome of the cell, or can be maintained transiently as an episomal element without being replicated, or can replicate independently as a plasmid. A cell is considered to have been 'stably transformed' when the transforming DNA is replicated with the division of the cell.    The terms 'polypeptide' or 'protein' means a macromolecule having the amino acid sequence of a native protein, that is, a protein produced by a naturally-occurring and non-recombinant cell; or it is produced by a genetically-engineered or recombinant cell, and comprise molecules having the amino acid sequence of the native protein, or molecules having deletions from, additions to, and/or substitutions of one or more amino acids of the native sequence. The term also includes amino acid polymers in which one or more amino acids are chemical analogs of a corresponding naturally-occurring amino acid and polymers. The terms 'polypeptide' and 'protein' specifically encompass PCSK9 antigen binding proteins, antibodies, or sequences that have deletions from, additions to, and/or substitutions of one or more amino acid of antigen-binding protein. The term 'polypeptide fragment' refers to a polypeptide that has an amino-terminal deletion, a carboxyl-terminal deletion, and/or an internal deletion as compared with the full-length native protein. Such fragments can also contain modified amino acids as compared with the native protein. In certain embodiments, fragments are about five to 500 amino acids long. For example, fragments can be at least 5, 6, 8, 10, 14, 20, 50, 70, 100, 110, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, or 450 amino acids long. Useful polypeptide fragments include immunologically functional fragments of antibodies, including binding domains. In the case of a PCSK9-binding antibody, useful fragments include but are not limited to a CDR region, a variable domain of a heavy and/or light chain, a portion of an antibody chain or just its variable region including two CDRs, and the like.    The term 'isolated protein' referred means that a subject protein (1) is free of at least some other proteins with which it would normally be found, (2) is essentially free of other proteins from the same source, e.g., from the same species, (3) is expressed by a cell from a different species, (4) has been separated from at least about 50 percent of polynucleotides, lipids, carbohydrates, or other materials with which it is associated in nature, (5) is operably associated (by covalent or noncovalent interaction) with a polypeptide with which it is not associated in nature, or (6) does not occur in nature. Typically, an 'isolated protein' constitutes at least about 5%, at least about 10%, at least about 25%, or at least about 50% of a given sample. Genomic DNA, cDNA, mRNA or other RNA, of synthetic origin, or any combination thereof can encode such an isolated protein. Preferably, the isolated protein is substantially free from proteins or polypeptides or other contaminants that are found in its natural environment that would interfere with its therapeutic, diagnostic, prophylactic, research or other use.    The term 'amino acid' includes its normal meaning in the art.    A 'variant' of a polypeptide (e.g., an antigen binding protein, or an antibody) comprises an amino acid sequence wherein one or more amino acid residues are inserted into, deleted from and/or substituted into the amino acid sequence relative to another polypeptide sequence. Variants include fusion proteins.    The term 'identity' refers to a relationship between the sequences of two or more polypeptide molecules or two or more nucleic acid molecules, as determined by aligning and comparing the sequences. 'Percent identity' means the percent of identical residues between the amino acids or nucleotides in the compared molecules and is calculated based on the size of the smallest of the molecules being compared. For these calculations, gaps in alignments (if any) are preferably addressed by a particular mathematical model or computer program (i.e., an 'algorithm'). Methods that can be used to calculate the identity of the aligned nucleic acids or polypeptides include those described in Computational Molecular Biology, (Lesk, A. M., ed.), 1988, New York: Oxford University Press; Biocomputing Informatics and Genome Projects, (Smith, D. W., ed.), 1993, New York: Academic Press; Computer Analysis of Sequence Data, Part I, (Griffin, A. M., and Griffin, H. G., eds.), 1994, New Jersey: Humana Press; von Heinje, G., 1987, Sequence Analysis in Molecular Biology, New York: Academic Press; Sequence Analysis Primer, (Gribskov, M. and Devereux, J., eds.), 1991, New York: M. Stockton Press; and Carillo et al., 1988, SIAM J. Applied Math. 48:1073.    In calculating percent identity, the sequences being compared are typically aligned in a way that gives the largest match between the sequences. One example of a computer program that can be used to determine percent identity is the GCG program package, which includes GAP (Devereux et al., 1984, Nucl. Acid Res. 12:387; Genetics Computer Group, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wis.). The computer algorithm GAP is used to align the two polypeptides or polynucleotides for which the percent sequence identity is to be determined. The sequences are aligned for optimal matching of their respective amino acid or nucleotide (the 'matched span', as determined by the algorithm). A gap opening penalty (which is calculated as 3.times. the average diagonal, wherein the 'average diagonal' is the average of the diagonal of the comparison matrix being used; the 'diagonal' is the score or number assigned to each perfect amino acid match by the particular comparison matrix) and a gap extension penalty (which is usually 1/10 times the gap opening penalty), as well as a comparison matrix such as PAM 250 or BLOSUM 62 are used in conjunction with the algorithm. In certain embodiments, a standard comparison matrix (see, Dayhoff et al., 1978, Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure 5:345-352 for the PAM 250 comparison matrix; Henikoff et al., 1992, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 89:10915-10919 for the BLOSUM 62 comparison matrix) is also used by the algorithm.    Examples of parameters that can be employed in determining percent identity for polypeptides or nucleotide sequences using the GAP program are the following: Algorithm: Needleman et al., 1970, J. Mol. Biol. 48:443-453 Comparison matrix: BLOSUM 62 from Henikoff et al., 1992, supra Gap Penalty: 12 (but with no penalty for end gaps) Gap Length Penalty: 4 Threshold of Similarity: 0    Certain alignment schemes for aligning two amino acid sequences may result in matching of only a short region of the two sequences, and this small aligned region may have very high sequence identity even though there is no significant relationship between the two full-length sequences. Accordingly; the selected alignment method (GAP program) can be adjusted if so desired to result in an alignment that spans at least 50 or other number of contiguous amino acids of the target polypeptide.    As used herein, the twenty conventional (e.g., naturally occurring) amino acids and their abbreviations follow conventional usage. See Immunology--A Synthesis (2nd Edition, E. S. Golub and D. R. Gren, Eds., Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, Mass. (1991)), which is incorporated herein by reference for any purpose. Stereoisomers (e.g., D-amino acids) of the twenty conventional amino acids, unnatural amino acids such as .alpha.-,.alpha.-disubstituted amino acids, N-alkyl amino acids, lactic acid, and other unconventional amino acids can also be suitable components for polypeptides of the present invention. Examples of unconventional amino acids include: 4-hydroxyproline, .gamma.-carboxyglutamate, .epsilon.-N,N,N-trimethyllysine, .epsilon.-N-acetyllysine, O-phosphoserine, N-acetylserine, N-formylmethionine, 3-methylhistidine, 5-hydroxylysine, .sigma.-N-methylarginine, and other similar amino acids and imino acids (e.g., 4-hydroxyproline). In the polypeptide notation used herein, the left-hand direction is the amino terminal direction and the right-hand direction is the carboxy-terminal direction, in accordance with standard usage and convention.    Similarly, unless specified otherwise, the left-hand end of single-stranded polynucleotide sequences is the 5' end; the left-hand direction of double-stranded polynucleotide sequences is referred to as the 5' direction. The direction of 5' to 3' addition of nascent RNA transcripts is referred to as the transcription direction; sequence regions on the DNA strand having the same sequence as the RNA and which are 5' to the 5' end of the RNA transcript are referred to as 'upstream sequences'; sequence regions on the DNA strand having the same sequence as the RNA and which are 3' to the 3' end of the RNA transcript are referred to as 'downstream sequences.'    Conservative amino acid substitutions can encompass non-naturally occurring amino acid residues, which are typically incorporated by chemical peptide synthesis rather than by synthesis in biological systems. These include peptidomimetics and other reversed or inverted forms of amino acid moieties.    Naturally occurring residues can be divided into classes based on common side chain properties:    1) hydrophobic: norleucine, Met, Ala, Val, Leu, Ile;    2) neutral hydrophilic: Cys, Ser, Thr, Asn, Gln;    3) acidic: Asp, Glu;    4) basic: His, Lys, Arg;    5) residues that influence chain orientation: Gly, Pro; and    6) aromatic: Trp, Tyr, Phe.    For example, non-conservative substitutions can involve the exchange of a member of one of these classes for a member from another class. Such substituted residues can be introduced, for example, into regions of a human antibody that are homologous with non-human antibodies, or into the non-homologous regions of the molecule.    In making changes to the antigen binding protein or the PCSK9 protein, according to certain embodiments, the hydropathic index of amino acids can be considered. Each amino acid has been assigned a hydropathic index on the basis of its hydrophobicity and charge characteristics. They are: isoleucine (+4.5); valine (+4.2); leucine (+3.8); phenylalanine (+2.8); cysteine/cystine (+2.5); methionine (+1.9); alanine (+1.8); glycine (-0.4); threonine (-0.7); serine (-0.8); tryptophan (-0.9); tyrosine (-1.3); proline (-1.6); histidine (-3.2); glutamate (-3.5); glutamine (-3.5); aspartate (-3.5); asparagine (-3.5); lysine (-3.9); and arginine (-4.5).    The importance of the hydropathic amino acid index in conferring interactive biological function on a protein is understood in the art. Kyte et al., J. Mol. Biol., 157:105-131 (1982). It is known that certain amino acids can be substituted for other amino acids having a similar hydropathic index or score and still retain a similar biological activity. In making changes based upon the hydropathic index, in certain embodiments, the substitution of amino acids whose hydropathic indices are within .+-.2 is included. In certain embodiments, those which are within .+-.1 are included, and in certain embodiments, those within .+-.0.5 are included.    It is also understood in the art that the substitution of like amino acids can be made effectively on the basis of hydrophilicity, particularly where the biologically functional protein or peptide thereby created is intended for use in immunological embodiments, as in the present case. In certain embodiments, the greatest local average hydrophilicity of a protein, as governed by the hydrophilicity of its adjacent amino acids, correlates with its immunogenicity and antigenicity, i.e., with a biological property of the protein.    The following hydrophilicity values have been assigned to these amino acid residues: arginine (+3.0); lysine (+3.0); aspartate (+3.0.+-.1); glutamate (+3.0.+-.1); serine (+0.3); asparagine (+0.2); glutamine (+0.2); glycine (0); threonine (-0.4); proline (-0.5.+-.1); alanine (-0.5); histidine (-0.5); cysteine (-1.0); methionine (-1.3); valine (-1.5); leucine (-1.8); isoleucine (-1.8); tyrosine (-2.3); phenylalanine (-2.5) and tryptophan (-3.4). In making changes based upon similar hydrophilicity values, in certain embodiments, the substitution of amino acids whose hydrophilicity values are within .+-.2 is included, in certain embodiments, those which are within .+-.1 are included, and in certain embodiments, those within .+-.0.5 are included. One can also identify epitopes from primary amino acid sequences on the basis of hydrophilicity. These regions are also referred to as 'epitopic core regions.'    Exemplary amino acid substitutions are set forth in Table 1.

In certain embodiments, derivatives comprise covalent modifications, including, but not limited to, chemical bonding with polymers, lipids, or other organic or inorganic moieties. In certain embodiments, a chemically modified antigen binding protein can have a greater circulating half-life than an antigen binding protein that is not chemically modified. In certain embodiments, a chemically modified antigen binding protein can have improved targeting capacity for desired cells, tissues, and/or organs. In some embodiments, a derivative antigen binding protein is covalently modified to include one or more water soluble polymer attachments, including, but not limited to, polyethylene glycol, polyoxyethylene glycol, or polypropylene glycol. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,640,835, 4,496,689, 4,301,144, 4,670,417, 4,791,192 and 4,179,337. In certain embodiments, a derivative antigen binding protein comprises one or more polymer, including, but not limited to, monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol, dextran, cellulose, or other carbohydrate based polymers, poly-(N-vinyl pyrrolidone)-polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol homopolymers, a polypropylene oxide/ethylene oxide co-polymer, polyoxyethylated polyols (e.g., glycerol) and polyvinyl alcohol, as well as mixtures of such polymers.    In certain embodiments, a derivative is covalently modified with polyethylene glycol (PEG) subunits. In certain embodiments, one or more water-soluble polymer is bonded at one or more specific position, for example at the amino terminus, of a derivative. In certain embodiments, one or more water-soluble polymer is randomly attached to one or more side chains of a derivative. In certain embodiments, PEG is used to improve the therapeutic capacity for an antigen binding protein. In certain embodiments, PEG is used to improve the therapeutic capacity for a humanized antibody. Certain such methods are discussed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,133,426, which is hereby incorporated by reference for any purpose.    Peptide analogs are commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry as non-peptide drugs with properties analogous to those of the template peptide. These types of non-peptide compound are termed 'peptide mimetics' or 'peptidomimetics.' Fauchere, J., Adv. Drug Res., 15:29 (1986); Veber & Freidinger, TINS, p. 392 (1985); and Evans et al., J. Med. Chem., 30:1229 (1987), which are incorporated herein by reference for any purpose. Such compounds are often developed with the aid of computerized molecular modeling. Peptide mimetics that are structurally similar to therapeutically useful peptides can be used to produce a similar therapeutic or prophylactic effect. Generally, peptidomimetics are structurally similar to a paradigm polypeptide (i.e., a polypeptide that has a biochemical property or pharmacological activity), such as human antibody, but have one or more peptide linkages optionally replaced by a linkage selected from: --CH.sub.2 NH--, --CH.sub.2 S--, --CH.sub.2--CH.sub.2--, --CH.dbd.CH-(cis and trans), --COCH.sub.2--, --CH(OH)CH.sub.2--, and --CH.sub.2 SO--, by methods well known in the art. Systematic substitution of one or more amino acids of a consensus sequence with a D-amino acid of the same type (e.g., D-lysine in place of L-lysine) can be used in certain embodiments to generate more stable peptides. In addition, constrained peptides comprising a consensus sequence or a substantially identical consensus sequence variation can be generated by methods known in the art (Rizo and Gierasch, Ann. Rev. Biochem., 61:387 (1992), incorporated herein by reference for any purpose); for example, by adding internal cysteine residues capable of forming intramolecular disulfide bridges which cyclize the peptide.    The term 'naturally occurring' as used throughout the specification in connection with biological materials such as polypeptides, nucleic acids, host cells, and the like, refers to materials which are found in nature or a form of the materials that is found in nature.    An 'antigen binding protein' ('ABP') as used herein means any protein that binds a specified target antigen. In the instant application, the specified target antigen is the PCSK9 protein or fragment thereof. 'Antigen binding protein' includes but is not limited to antibodies and binding parts thereof, such as immunologically functional fragments. Peptibodies are another example of antigen binding proteins. The term 'immunologically functional fragment' (or simply 'fragment') of an antibody or immunoglobulin chain (heavy or light chain) antigen binding protein, as used herein, is a species of antigen binding protein comprising a portion (regardless of how that portion is obtained or synthesized) of an antibody that lacks at least some of the amino acids present in a full-length chain but which is still capable of specifically binding to an antigen. Such fragments are biologically active in that they bind to the target antigen and can compete with other antigen binding proteins, including intact antibodies, for binding to a given epitope. In some embodiments, the fragments are neutralizing fragments. In some embodiments, the fragments can block or reduce the likelihood of the interaction between LDLR and PCSK9. In one aspect, such a fragment will retain at least one CDR present in the full-length light or heavy chain, and in some embodiments will comprise a single heavy chain and/or light chain or portion thereof. These biologically active fragments can be produced by recombinant DNA techniques, or can be produced by enzymatic or chemical cleavage of antigen binding proteins, including intact antibodies. Immunologically functional immunoglobulin fragments include, but are not limited to, Fab, a diabody (heavy chain variable domain on the same polypeptide as a light chain variable domain, connected via a short peptide linker that is too short to permit pairing between the two domains on the same chain), Fab', F(ab').sub.2, Fv, domain antibodies and single-chain antibodies, and can be derived from any mammalian source, including but not limited to human, mouse, rat, camelid or rabbit. It is further contemplated that a functional portion of the antigen binding proteins disclosed herein, for example, one or more CDRs, could be covalently bound to a second protein or to a small molecule to create a therapeutic agent directed to a particular target in the body, possessing bifunctional therapeutic properties, or having a prolonged serum half-life. As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, an antigen binding protein can include nonprotein components. In some sections of the present disclosure, examples of ABPs are described herein in terms of 'number/letter/number' (e.g., 25A7). In these cases, the exact name denotes a specific antibody. That is, an ABP named 25A7 is not necessarily the same as an antibody named 25A7.1, (unless they are explicitly taught as the same in the specification, e.g., 25A7 and 25A7.3). As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, in some embodiments LDLR is not an antigen binding protein. In some embodiments, binding subsections of LDLR are not antigen binding proteins, e.g., EGFa. In some embodiments, other molecules through which PCSK9 signals in vivo are not antigen binding proteins. Such embodiments will be explicitly identified as such.    Certain antigen binding proteins described herein are antibodies or are derived from antibodies. In certain embodiments, the polypeptide structure of the antigen binding proteins is based on antibodies, including, but not limited to, monoclonal antibodies, bispecific antibodies, minibodies, domain antibodies, synthetic antibodies (sometimes referred to herein as 'antibody mimetics'), chimeric antibodies, humanized antibodies, human antibodies, antibody fusions (sometimes referred to herein as 'antibody conjugates'), and fragments thereof, respectively. In some embodiments, the ABP comprises or consists of avimers (tightly binding peptide). These various antigen binding proteins are further described herein.    An 'Fc' region comprises two heavy chain fragments comprising the C.sub.H1 and C.sub.H2 domains of an antibody. The two heavy chain fragments are held together by two or more disulfide bonds and by hydrophobic interactions of the C.sub.H3 domains.    A 'Fab fragment' comprises one light chain and the C.sub.H1 and variable regions of one heavy chain. The heavy chain of a Fab molecule cannot form a disulfide bond with another heavy chain molecule.    A 'Fab' fragment' comprises one light chain and a portion of one heavy chain that contains the VH domain and the C.sub.H1 domain and also the region between the C.sub.H1 and C.sub.H2 domains, such that an interchain disulfide bond can be formed between the two heavy chains of two Fab' fragments to form an F(ab').sub.2 molecule.    A 'F(ab').sub.2 fragment' contains two light chains and two heavy chains containing a portion of the constant region between the C.sub.H1 and C.sub.H2 domains, such that an interchain disulfide bond is formed between the two heavy chains. A F(ab').sub.2 fragment thus is composed of two Fab' fragments that are held together by a disulfide bond between the two heavy chains.    The 'Fv region' comprises the variable regions from both the heavy and light chains, but lacks the constant regions.    'Single-chain antibodies' are Fv molecules in which the heavy and light chain variable regions have been connected by a flexible linker to form a single polypeptide chain, which forms an antigen binding region. Single chain antibodies are discussed in detail in International Patent Application Publication No. WO 88/01649 and U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,946,778 and No. 5,260,203, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference.    A 'domain antibody' is an immunologically functional immunoglobulin fragment containing only the variable region of a heavy chain or the variable region of a light chain. In some instances, two or more V.sub.H regions are covalently joined with a peptide linker to create a bivalent domain antibody. The two V.sub.H regions of a bivalent domain antibody can target the same or different antigens.    A 'bivalent antigen binding protein' or 'bivalent antibody' comprises two antigen binding sites. In some instances, the two binding sites have the same antigen specificities. Bivalent antigen binding proteins and bivalent antibodies can be bispecific, see, infra. A bivalent antibody other than a 'multispecific' or 'multifunctional' antibody, in certain embodiments, typically is understood to have each of its binding sites identical.    A 'multispecific antigen binding protein' or 'multispecific antibody' is one that targets more than one antigen or epitope.    A 'bispecific,' 'dual-specific' or 'bifunctional' antigen binding protein or antibody is a hybrid antigen binding protein or antibody, respectively, having two different antigen binding sites. Bispecific antigen binding proteins and antibodies are a species of multispecific antigen binding protein antibody and can be produced by a variety of methods including, but not limited to, fusion of hybridomas or linking of Fab' fragments. See, e.g., Songsivilai and Lachmann, 1990, Clin. Exp. Immunol. 79:315-321; Kostelny et al., 1992, J. Immunol. 148:1547-1553. The two binding sites of a bispecific antigen binding protein or antibody will bind to two different epitopes, which can reside on the same or different protein targets.    An antigen binding protein is said to 'specifically bind' its target antigen when the dissociation constant (K.sub.d) is .ltoreq.10.sup.-7 M. The ABP specifically binds antigen with 'high affinity' when the K.sub.d is .ltoreq.5.times.10.sup.-9 M, and with 'very high affinity' when the K.sub.d is .ltoreq.5.times.10.sup.-10 M. In one embodiment, the ABP has a K.sub.d of .ltoreq.10.sup.-9 M. In one embodiment, the off-rate is .ltoreq.1.times.10.sup.-5. In other embodiments, the ABPs will bind to human PCSK9 with a K.sub.d of between about 10.sup.-9 M and 10.sup.-13 M, and in yet another embodiment the ABPs will bind with a K.sub.d.ltoreq.5.times.10.sup.-10. As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, in some embodiments, any or all of the antigen binding fragments can specifically bind to PCSK9.    An antigen binding protein is 'selective' when it binds to one target more tightly than it binds to a second target.    'Antigen binding region' means a protein, or a portion of a protein, that specifically binds a specified antigen (e.g., a paratope). For example, that portion of an antigen binding protein that contains the amino acid residues that interact with an antigen and confer on the antigen binding protein its specificity and affinity for the antigen is referred to as 'antigen binding region.' An antigen binding region typically includes one or more 'complementary binding regions' ('CDRs'). Certain antigen binding regions also include one or more 'framework' regions. A 'CDR' is an amino acid sequence that contributes to antigen binding specificity and affinity. 'Framework' regions can aid in maintaining the proper conformation of the CDRs to promote binding between the antigen binding region and an antigen. Structurally, framework regions can be located in antibodies between CDRs. Examples of framework and CDR regions are shown in FIGS. 2A-3D, 3CCC-3JJJ, and 15A-15D. In some embodiments, the sequences for CDRs for the light chain of antibody 3B6 are as follows: CDR1 TLSSGYSSYEVD (SEQ ID NO: 279); CDR2VDTGGIVGSKGE (SEQ ID NO: 280); CDR3 GADHGSGTNFVVV (SEQ ID NO: 281), and the FRs are as follows: FR1 QPVLTQPLFASASLGASVTLTC (SEQ ID NO: 282); FR2WYQQRPGKGPRFVMR (SEQ ID NO: 283); FR3GIPDRFSVLGSGLNRYLTIKNIQEEDESDYHC (SEQ ID NO: 284); and FR4FGGGTKLTVL (SEQ ID NO: 285).    In certain aspects, recombinant antigen binding proteins that bind PCSK9, for example human PCSK9, are provided. In this context, a 'recombinant antigen binding protein' is a protein made using recombinant techniques, i.e., through the expression of a recombinant nucleic acid as described herein. Methods and techniques for the production of recombinant proteins are well known in the art.    The term 'antibody' refers to an intact immunoglobulin of any isotype, or a fragment thereof that can compete with the intact antibody for specific binding to the target antigen, and includes, for instance, chimeric, humanized, fully human, and bispecific antibodies. An 'antibody' is a species of an antigen binding protein. An intact antibody will generally comprise at least two full-length heavy chains and two full-length light chains, but in some instances can include fewer chains such as antibodies naturally occurring in camelids which can comprise only heavy chains. Antibodies can be derived solely from a single source, or can be 'chimeric,' that is, different portions of the antibody can be derived from two different antibodies as described further below. The antigen binding proteins, antibodies, or binding fragments can be produced in hybridomas, by recombinant DNA techniques, or by enzymatic or chemical cleavage of intact antibodies. Unless otherwise indicated, the term 'antibody' includes, in addition to antibodies comprising two full-length heavy chains and two full-length light chains, derivatives, variants, fragments, and muteins thereof, examples of which are described below. Furthermore, unless explicitly excluded, antibodies include monoclonal antibodies, bispecific antibodies, minibodies, domain antibodies, synthetic antibodies (sometimes referred to herein as 'antibody mimetics'), chimeric antibodies, humanized antibodies, human antibodies, antibody fusions (sometimes referred to herein as 'antibody conjugates'), and fragments thereof, respectively. In some embodiments, the term also encompasses peptibodies.    Naturally occurring antibody structural units typically comprise a tetramer. Each such tetramer typically is composed of two identical pairs of polypeptide chains, each pair having one full-length 'light' (in certain embodiments, about 25 kDa) and one full-length 'heavy' chain (in certain embodiments, about 50-70 kDa). The amino-terminal portion of each chain typically includes a variable region of about 100 to 10 or more amino acids that typically is responsible for antigen recognition. The carboxy-terminal portion of each chain typically defines a constant region that can be responsible for effector function. Human light chains are typically classified as kappa and lambda light chains. Heavy chains are typically classified as mu, delta, gamma, alpha, or epsilon, and define the antibody's isotype as IgM, IgD, IgG, IgA, and IgE, respectively. IgG has several subclasses, including, but not limited to, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4. IgM has subclasses including, but not limited to, IgM1 and IgM2. IgA is similarly subdivided into subclasses including, but not limited to, IgA1 and IgA2. Within full-length light and heavy chains, typically, the variable and constant regions are joined by a 'J' region of about 12 or more amino acids, with the heavy chain also including a 'D' region of about 10 more amino acids. See, e.g., Fundamental Immunology, Ch. 7 (Paul, W., ed., 2nd ed. Raven Press, N.Y. (1989)) (incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes). The variable regions of each light/heavy chain pair typically form the antigen binding site.    The variable regions typically exhibit the same general structure of relatively conserved framework regions (FR) joined by three hyper variable regions, also called complementarity determining regions or CDRs. The CDRs from the two chains of each pair typically are aligned by the framework regions, which can enable binding to a specific epitope. From N-terminal to C-terminal, both light and heavy chain variable regions typically comprise the domains FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3 and FR4. The assignment of amino acids to each domain is typically in accordance with the definitions of Kabat Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1987 and 1991)), or Chothia & Lesk, J. Mol. Biol., 196:901-917 (1987); Chothia et al., Nature, 342:878-883 (1989).    In certain embodiments, an antibody heavy chain binds to an antigen in the absence of an antibody light chain. In certain embodiments, an antibody light chain binds to an antigen in the absence of an antibody heavy chain. In certain embodiments, an antibody binding region binds to an antigen in the absence of an antibody light chain. In certain embodiments, an antibody binding region binds to an antigen in the absence of an antibody heavy chain. In certain embodiments, an individual variable region specifically binds to an antigen in the absence of other variable regions.    In certain embodiments, definitive delineation of a CDR and identification of residues comprising the binding site of an antibody is accomplished by solving the structure of the antibody and/or solving the structure of the antibody-ligand complex. In certain embodiments, that can be accomplished by any of a variety of techniques known to those skilled in the art, such as X-ray crystallography. In certain embodiments, various methods of analysis can be employed to identify or approximate the CDR regions. Examples of such methods include, but are not limited to, the Kabat definition, the Chothia definition, the AbM definition and the contact definition.    The Kabat definition is a standard for numbering the residues in an antibody and is typically used to identify CDR regions. See, e.g., Johnson & Wu, Nucleic Acids Res., 28: 214-8 (2000). The Chothia definition is similar to the Kabat definition, but the Chothia definition takes into account positions of certain structural loop regions. See, e.g., Chothia et al., J. Mol. Biol., 196: 901-17 (1986); Chothia et al., Nature, 342: 877-83 (1989). The AbM definition uses an integrated suite of computer programs produced by Oxford Molecular Group that model antibody structure. See, e.g., Martin et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci (USA), 86:9268-9272 (1989); 'AbM.TM., A Computer Program for Modeling Variable Regions of Antibodies,' Oxford, UK; Oxford Molecular, Ltd. The AbM definition models the tertiary structure of an antibody from primary sequence using a combination of knowledge databases and ab initio methods, such as those described by Samudrala et al., 'Ab Initio Protein Structure Prediction Using a Combined Hierarchical Approach,' in PROTEINS, Structure, Function and Genetics Suppl., 3:194-198 (1999). The contact definition is based on an analysis of the available complex crystal structures. See, e.g., MacCallum et al., J. Mol. Biol., 5:732-45 (1996).    By convention, the CDR regions in the heavy chain are typically referred to as H1, H2, and H3 and are numbered sequentially in the direction from the amino terminus to the carboxy terminus. The CDR regions in the light chain are typically referred to as L1, L2, and L3 and are numbered sequentially in the direction from the amino terminus to the carboxy terminus.    The term 'light chain' includes a full-length light chain and fragments thereof having sufficient variable region sequence to confer binding specificity. A full-length light chain includes a variable region domain, V.sub.L, and a constant region domain, C.sub.L. The variable region domain of the light chain is at the amino-terminus of the polypeptide. Light chains include kappa chains and lambda chains.    The term 'heavy chain' includes a full-length heavy chain and fragments thereof having sufficient variable region sequence to confer binding specificity. A full-length heavy chain includes a variable region domain, V.sub.H, and three constant region domains, C.sub.H1, C.sub.H2, and C.sub.H3. The V.sub.H domain is at the amino-terminus of the polypeptide, and the C.sub.H domains are at the carboxyl-terminus, with the C.sub.H3 being closest to the carboxy-terminus of the polypeptide. Heavy chains can be of any isotype, including IgG (including IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4 subtypes), IgA (including IgA1 and IgA2 subtypes), IgM and IgE.    A bispecific or bifunctional antibody typically is an artificial hybrid antibody having two different heavy/light chain pairs and two different binding sites. Bispecific antibodies can be produced by a variety of methods including, but not limited to, fusion of hybridomas or linking of Fab' fragments. See, e.g., Songsivilai et al., Clin. Exp. Immunol., 79: 315-321 (1990); Kostelny et al., J. Immunol., 148:1547-1553 (1992).    Some species of mammals also produce antibodies having only a single heavy chain.    Each individual immunoglobulin chain is typically composed of several 'immunoglobulin domains,' each consisting of roughly 90 to 110 amino acids and having a characteristic folding pattern. These domains are the basic units of which antibody polypeptides are composed. In humans, the IgA and IgD isotypes contain four heavy chains and four light chains; the IgG and IgE isotypes contain two heavy chains and two light chains; and the IgM isotype contains five heavy chains and five light chains. The heavy chain C region typically comprises one or more domains that can be responsible for effector function. The number of heavy chain constant region domains will depend on the isotype. IgG heavy chains, for example, contain three C region domains known as C.sub.H1, C.sub.H2 and C.sub.H3. The antibodies that are provided can have any of these isotypes and subtypes. In certain embodiments of the present invention, an anti-PCSK9 antibody is of the IgG2 or IgG4 subtype.    The term 'variable region' or 'variable domain' refers to a portion of the light and/or heavy chains of an antibody, typically including approximately the amino-terminal 120 to 130 amino acids in the heavy chain and about 100 to 110 amino terminal amino acids in the light chain. In certain embodiments, variable regions of different antibodies differ extensively in amino acid sequence even among antibodies of the same species. The variable region of an antibody typically determines specificity of a particular antibody for its target    The term 'neutralizing antigen binding protein' or 'neutralizing antibody' refers to an antigen binding protein or antibody, respectively, that binds to a ligand and prevents or reduces the biological effect of that ligand. This can be done, for example, by directly blocking a binding site on the ligand or by binding to the ligand and altering the ligand's ability to bind through indirect means (such as structural or energetic alterations in the ligand). In some embodiments, the term can also denote an antigen binding protein that prevents the protein to which it is bound from performing a biological function. In assessing the binding and/or specificity of an antigen binding protein, e.g., an antibody or immunologically functional fragment thereof, an antibody or fragment can substantially inhibit binding of a ligand to its binding partner when an excess of antibody reduces the quantity of binding partner bound to the ligand by at least about 1-20, 20-30%, 30-40%, 40-50%, 50-60%, 60-70%, 70-80%, 80-85%, 85-90%, 90-95%, 95-97%, 97-98%, 98-99% or more (as measured in an in vitro competitive binding assay). In some embodiments, in the case of PCSK9 antigen binding proteins, such a neutralizing molecule can diminish the ability of PCSK9 to bind the LDLR. In some embodiments, the neutralizing ability is characterized and/or described via a competition assay. In some embodiments, the neutralizing ability is described in terms of an IC.sub.50 or EC.sub.50 value. In some embodiments, ABPs 27B2, 13H1, 13B5 and 3C4 are non-neutralizing ABPs, 3B6, 9C9 and 31A4 are weak neutralizers, and the remaining ABPs in Table 2 are strong neutralizers. In some embodiments, the antibodies or antigen binding proteins neutralize by binding to PCSK9 and preventing PCSK9 from binding to LDLR (or reducing the ability of PCSK9 to bind to LDLR). In some embodiments, the antibodies or ABPs neutralize by binding to PCSK9, and while still allowing PCSK9 to bind to LDLR, preventing or reducing the PCSK9 mediated degradation of LDLR. Thus, in some embodiments, a neutralizing ABP or antibody can still permit PCSK9/LDLR binding, but will prevent (or reduce) subsequent PCSK9 involved degradation of LDLR.    The term 'target' refers to a molecule or a portion of a molecule capable of being bound by an antigen binding protein. In certain embodiments, a target can have one or more epitopes. In certain embodiments, a target is an antigen. The use of 'antigen' in the phrase 'antigen binding protein' simply denotes that the protein sequence that comprises the antigen can be bound by an antibody. In this context, it does not require that the protein be foreign or that it be capable of inducing an immune response.    The term 'compete' when used in the context of antigen binding proteins (e.g., neutralizing antigen binding proteins or neutralizing antibodies) that compete for the same epitope means competition between antigen binding proteins as determined by an assay in which the antigen binding protein (e.g., antibody or immunologically functional fragment thereof) being tested prevents or inhibits (e.g., reduces) specific binding of a reference antigen binding protein (e.g., a ligand, or a reference antibody) to a common antigen (e.g., PCSK9 or a fragment thereof). Numerous types of competitive binding assays can be used to determine if one antigen binding protein competes with another, for example: solid phase direct or indirect radioimmunoassay (RIA), solid phase direct or indirect enzyme immunoassay (EIA), sandwich competition assay (see, e.g., Stahli et al., 1983, Methods in Enzymology 9:242-253); solid phase direct biotin-avidin EIA (see, e.g., Kirkland et al., 1986, J. Immunol. 137:3614-3619) solid phase direct labeled assay, solid phase direct labeled sandwich assay (see, e.g., Harlow and Lane, 1988, Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Press); solid phase direct label RIA using I-125 label (see, e.g., Morel et al., 1988, Molec. Immunol. 25:7-15); solid phase direct biotin-avidin EIA (see, e.g., Cheung, et al., 1990, Virology 176:546-552); and direct labeled RIA (Moldenhauer et al., 1990, Scand. J. Immunol. 32:77-82). Typically, such an assay involves the use of purified antigen bound to a solid surface or cells bearing either of these, an unlabelled test antigen binding protein and a labeled reference antigen binding protein. Competitive inhibition is measured by determining the amount of label bound to the solid surface or cells in the presence of the test antigen binding protein. Usually the test antigen binding protein is present in excess. Antigen binding proteins identified by competition assay (competing antigen binding proteins) include antigen binding proteins binding to the same epitope as the reference antigen binding proteins and antigen binding proteins binding to an adjacent epitope sufficiently proximal to the epitope bound by the reference antigen binding protein for steric hindrance to occur. Additional details regarding methods for determining competitive binding are provided in the examples herein. Usually, when a competing antigen binding protein is present in excess, it will inhibit (e.g., reduce) specific binding of a reference antigen binding protein to a common antigen by at least 40-45%, 45-50%, 50-55%, 55-60%, 60-65%, 65-70%, 70-75% or 75% or more. In some instances, binding is inhibited by at least 80-85%, 85-90%, 90-95%, 95-97%, or 97% or more.    The term 'antigen' refers to a molecule or a portion of a molecule capable of being bound by a selective binding agent, such as an antigen binding protein (including, e.g., an antibody or immunological functional fragment thereof). In some embodiments, the antigen is capable of being used in an animal to produce antibodies capable of binding to that antigen. An antigen can possess one or more epitopes that are capable of interacting with different antigen binding proteins, e.g., antibodies.    The term 'epitope' includes any determinant capable being bound by an antigen binding protein, such as an antibody or to a T-cell receptor. An epitope is a region of an antigen that is bound by an antigen binding protein that targets that antigen, and when the antigen is a protein, includes specific amino acids that directly contact the antigen binding protein. Most often, epitopes reside on proteins, but in some instances can reside on other kinds of molecules, such as nucleic acids. Epitope determinants can include chemically active surface groupings of molecules such as amino acids, sugar side chains, phosphoryl or sulfonyl groups, and can have specific three dimensional structural characteristics, and/or specific charge characteristics. Generally, antibodies specific for a particular target antigen will preferentially recognize an epitope on the target antigen in a complex mixture of proteins and/or macromolecules.    As used herein, 'substantially pure' means that the described species of molecule is the predominant species present, that is, on a molar basis it is more abundant than any other individual species in the same mixture. In certain embodiments, a substantially pure molecule is a composition wherein the object species comprises at least 50% (on a molar basis) of all macromolecular species present. In other embodiments, a substantially pure composition will comprise at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, or 99% of all macromolecular species present in the composition. In other embodiments, the object species is purified to essential homogeneity wherein contaminating species cannot be detected in the composition by conventional detection methods and thus the composition consists of a single detectable macromolecular species.    The term 'agent' is used herein to denote a chemical compound, a mixture of chemical compounds, a biological macromolecule, or an extract made from biological materials.    As used herein, the terms 'label' or 'labeled' refers to incorporation of a detectable marker, e.g., by incorporation of a radiolabeled amino acid or attachment to a polypeptide of biotin moieties that can be detected by marked avidin (e.g., streptavidin containing a fluorescent marker or enzymatic activity that can be detected by optical or colorimetric methods). In certain embodiments, the label or marker can also be therapeutic. Various methods of labeling polypeptides and glycoproteins are known in the art and can be used. Examples of labels for polypeptides include, but are not limited to, the following: radioisotopes or radionuclides (e.g., .sup.3H, .sup.14C, .sup.15N, .sup.35S, .sup.90Y, .sup.99Tc, .sup.111In, .sup.125I, .sup.131I), fluorescent labels (e.g., FITC, rhodamine, lanthanide phosphors), enzymatic labels (e.g., horseradish peroxidase, .beta.-galactosidase, luciferase, alkaline phosphatase), chemiluminescent, biotinyl groups, predetermined polypeptide epitopes recognized by a secondary reporter (e.g., leucine zipper pair sequences, binding sites for secondary antibodies, metal binding domains, epitope tags). In certain embodiments, labels are attached by spacer arms of various lengths to reduce potential steric hindrance.    The term 'biological sample', as used herein, includes, but is not limited to, any quantity of a substance from a living thing or formerly living thing. Such living things include, but are not limited to, humans, mice, monkeys, rats, rabbits, and other animals. Such substances include, but are not limited to, blood, serum, urine, cells, organs, tissues, bone, bone marrow, lymph nodes, and skin.    The term 'pharmaceutical agent composition' (or agent or drug) as used herein refers to a chemical compound, composition, agent or drug capable of inducing a desired therapeutic effect when properly administered to a patient. It does not necessarily require more than one type of ingredient.    The term 'therapeutically effective amount' refers to the amount of a PCSK9 antigen binding protein determined to produce a therapeutic response in a mammal. Such therapeutically effective amounts are readily ascertained by one of ordinary skill in the art.    The term 'modulator,' as used herein, is a compound that changes or alters the activity or function of a molecule. For example, a modulator can cause an increase or decrease in the magnitude of a certain activity or function of a molecule compared to the magnitude of the activity or function observed in the absence of the modulator. In certain embodiments, a modulator is an inhibitor, which decreases the magnitude of at least one activity or function of a molecule. Certain exemplary activities and functions of a molecule include, but are not limited to, binding affinity, enzymatic activity, and signal transduction. Certain exemplary inhibitors include, but are not limited to, proteins, peptides, antibodies, peptibodies, carbohydrates or small organic molecules. Peptibodies are described in, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,660,843 (corresponding to PCT Application No. WO 01/83525).    The terms 'patient' and 'subject' are used interchangeably and include human and non-human animal subjects as well as those with formally diagnosed disorders, those without formally recognized disorders, those receiving medical attention, those at risk of developing the disorders, etc.    The term 'treat' and 'treatment' includes therapeutic treatments, prophylactic treatments, and applications in which one reduces the risk that a subject will develop a disorder or other risk factor. Treatment does not require the complete curing of a disorder and encompasses embodiments in which one reduces symptoms or underlying risk factors.    The term 'prevent' does not require the 100% elimination of the possibility of an event. Rather, it denotes that the likelihood of the occurrence of the event has been reduced in the presence of the compound or method.    Standard techniques can be used for recombinant DNA, oligonucleotide synthesis, and tissue culture and transformation (e.g., electroporation, lipofection). Enzymatic reactions and purification techniques can be performed according to manufacturer's specifications or as commonly accomplished in the art or as described herein. The foregoing techniques and procedures can be generally performed according to conventional methods well known in the art and as described in various general and more specific references that are cited and discussed throughout the present specification. See, e.g., Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual (2d ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1989)), which is incorporated herein by reference for any purpose. Unless specific definitions are provided, the nomenclatures utilized in connection with, and the laboratory procedures and techniques of, analytical chemistry, synthetic organic chemistry, and medicinal and pharmaceutical chemistry described herein are those well known and commonly used in the art. Standard techniques can be used for chemical syntheses, chemical analyses, pharmaceutical preparation, formulation, and delivery, and treatment of patients.    Antigen Binding Proteins to PCSK9    Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a serine protease involved in regulating the levels of the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) protein (Horton et al., 2007; Seidah and Prat, 2007). PCSK9 is a prohormone-proprotein convertase in the subtilisin (S8) family of serine proteases (Seidah et al., 2003). An exemplary human PCSK9 amino acid sequence is presented as SEQ ID NOs: 1 and 3. in FIG. 1A (depicting the 'pro' domain of the protein as underlined) and FIG. 1B (depicting the signal sequence in bold and the pro domain underlined). An exemplary human PCSK9 coding sequence is presented as SEQ ID NO: 2 (FIG. 1B). As described herein, PCSK9 proteins can also include fragments of the full length PCSK9 protein. The structure of the PCSK9 protein has recently been solved by two groups (Cunningham et al., Nature Structural & Molecular Biology, 2007, and Piper et al., Structure, 15:1-8, 2007), the entireties of both of which are herein incorporated by reference. PCSK9 includes a signal sequence, a N-terminal prodomain, a subtilisin-like catalytic domain and a C-terminal domain.    Antigen binding proteins (ABPs) that bind PCSK9, including human PCSK9, are provided herein. In some embodiments, the antigen binding proteins provided are polypeptides which comprise one or more complementary determining regions (CDRs), as described herein. In some antigen binding proteins, the CDRs are embedded into a 'framework' region, which orients the CDR(s) such that the proper antigen binding properties of the CDR(s) is achieved. In some embodiments, antigen binding proteins provided herein can interfere with, block, reduce or modulate the interaction between PCSK9 and LDLR. Such antigen binding proteins are denoted as 'neutralizing.' In some embodiments, binding between PCSK9 and LDLR can still occur, even though the antigen binding protein is neutralizing and bound to PCSK9. For example, in some embodiments, the ABP prevents or reduces the adverse influence of PCSK9 on LDLR without blocking the LDLR binding site on PCSK9. Thus, in some embodiments, the ABP modulates or alters PCSK9's ability to result in the degradation of LDLR, without having to prevent the binding interaction between PCSK9 and LDLR. Such ABPs can be specifically described as 'non-competitively neutralizing' ABPs. In some embodiments, the neutralizing ABP binds to PCSK9 in a location and/or manner that prevents PCSK9 from binding to LDLR. Such ABPs can be specifically described as 'competitively neutralizing' ABPs. Both of the above neutralizers can result in a greater amount of free LDLR being present in a subject, which results in more LDLR binding to LDL (thereby reducing the amount of LDL in the subject). In turn, this results in a reduction in the amount of serum cholesterol present in a subject.    In some embodiments, the antigen binding proteins provided herein are capable of inhibiting PCSK9-mediated activity (including binding). In some embodiments, antigen binding proteins binding to these epitopes inhibit, inter alia, interactions between PCSK9 and LDLR and other physiological effects mediated by PCSK9. In some embodiments, the antigen binding proteins are human, such as fully human antibodies to PCSK9.    In some embodiments, the ABP binds to the catalytic domain of PCSK9. In some embodiments, the ABP binds to the mature form of PCSK9. In some embodiments the ABP binds in the prodomain of PCSK9. In some embodiments, the ABP selectively binds to the mature form of PCSK9. In some embodiments, the ABP binds to the catalytic domain in a manner such that PCSK9 cannot bind or bind as efficiently to LDLR. In some embodiments, the antigen binding protein does not bind to the c-terminus of the cataylytic domain. In some embodiments, the antigen binding protein does not bind to the n-terminus of the catalytic domain. In some embodiments, the ABP does not bind to the n- or c-terminus of the PCSK9 protein. In some embodiments, the ABP binds to any one of the epitopes bound by the antibodies discussed herein. In some embodiments, this can be determined by competition assays between the antibodies disclosed herein and other antibodies. In some embodiments, the ABP binds to an epitope bound by one of the antibodies described in Table 2. In some embodiments, the antigen binding proteins bind to a specific conformational state of PCSK9 so as to prevent PCSK9 from interacting with LDLR. In some embodiments, the ABP binds to the V domain of PCSK9. In some embodiments, the ABP binds to the V domain of PCSK9 and prevents (or reduces) PCSK9 from binding to LDLR. In some embodiments, the ABP binds to the V domain of PCSK9, and while it does not prevent (or reduce) the binding of PCSK9 to LDLR, the ABP prevents or reduces the adverse activities mediated through PCSK9 on LDLR.    The antigen binding proteins that are disclosed herein have a variety of utilities. Some of the antigen binding proteins, for instance, are useful in specific binding assays, affinity purification of PCSK9, in particular human PCSK9 or its ligands and in screening assays to identify other antagonists of PCSK9 activity. Some of the antigen binding proteins are useful for inhibiting binding of PCSK9 to LDLR, or inhibiting PCSK9-mediated activities.    The antigen binding proteins can be used in a variety of therapeutic applications, as explained herein. For example, in some embodiments the PCSK9 antigen binding proteins are useful for treating conditions associated with PCSK9, such as cholesterol related disorders (or 'serum cholesterol related disorders') such as hypercholesterolemia, as further described herein. Other uses for the antigen binding proteins include, for example, diagnosis of PCSK9-associated diseases or conditions and screening assays to determine the presence or absence of PCSK9. Some of the antigen binding proteins described herein are useful in treating consequences, symptoms, and/or the pathology associated with PCSK9 activity.    In some embodiments, the antigen binding proteins that are provided comprise one or more CDRs (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 CDRs). In some embodiments, the antigen binding protein comprises (a) a polypeptide structure and (b) one or more CDRs that are inserted into and/or joined to the polypeptide structure. The polypeptide structure can take a variety of different forms. For example, it can be, or comprise, the framework of a naturally occurring antibody, or fragment or variant thereof, or can be completely synthetic in nature. Examples of various polypeptide structures are further described below.    In certain embodiments, the polypeptide structure of the antigen binding proteins is an antibody or is derived from an antibody, including, but not limited to, monoclonal antibodies, bispecific antibodies, minibodies, domain antibodies, synthetic antibodies (sometimes referred to herein as 'antibody mimetics'), chimeric antibodies, humanized antibodies, antibody fusions (sometimes referred to as 'antibody conjugates'), and portions or fragments of each, respectively. In some instances, the antigen binding protein is an immunological fragment of an antibody (e.g., a Fab, a Fab', a F(ab').sub.2, or a scFv). The various structures are further described and defined herein.    Certain of the antigen binding proteins as provided herein specifically and/or selectively bind to human PCSK9. In some embodiments, the antigen binding protein specifically and/or selectively binds to human PCSK9 protein having and/or consisting of residues 153-692 of SEQ ID NO: 3. In some embodiments the ABP specifically and/or selectively binds to human PCSK9 having and/or consisting of residues 31-152 of SEQ ID NO: 3. In some embodiments, the ABP selectively binds to a human PCSK9 protein as depicted in FIG. 1A (SEQ ID NO: 1). In some embodiments, the antigen binding protein specifically binds to at least a fragment of the PCSK9 protein and/or a full length PCSK9 protein, with or without a signal sequence.    In embodiments where the antigen binding protein is used for therapeutic applications, an antigen binding protein can inhibit, interfere with or modulate one or more biological activities of PCSK9. In one embodiment, an antigen binding protein binds specifically to human PCSK9 and/or substantially inhibits binding of human PCSK9 to LDLR by at least about 20%-40%, 40-60%, 60-80%, 80-85%, or more (for example, by measuring binding in an in vitro competitive binding assay). Some of the antigen binding proteins that are provided herein are antibodies. In some embodiments, the ABP has a K.sub.d of less (binding more tightly) than 10.sup.-7, 10.sup.-8, 10.sup.-9, 10.sup.-10, 10.sup.-11, 10.sup.-12, 10.sup.-13 M. In some embodiments, the ABP has an IC.sub.50 for blocking the binding of LDLR to PCSK9 (D374Y, high affinity variant) of less than 1 microM, 1000 nM to 100 nM, 100mM to 10 nM, 1 nM to 1 nM, 1000 pM to 500 pM, 500 pM to 200 pM, less than 200 pM, 200 pM to 150 pM, 200 pM to 100 pM, 100 pM to 10 pM, 10 pM to 1 pM.    One example of an IgG2 heavy chain constant domain of an anti-PCSK9 antibody of the present invention has the amino acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO: 154, FIG. 3KK.    One example of an IgG4 heavy chain constant domain of an anti-PCSK9 antibody of the present invention has the amino acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO: 155, FIG. 3KK.    One example of a kappa light chain constant domain of an anti-PCSK9 antibody has the amino acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO: 157, FIG. 3KK.    One example of a lambda light chain constant domain of an anti-PCSK9 antibody has the amino acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO: 156, FIG. 3KK.    Variable regions of immunoglobulin chains generally exhibit the same overall structure, comprising relatively conserved framework regions (FR) joined by three hypervariable regions, more often called 'complementarity determining regions' or CDRs. The CDRs from the two chains of each heavy chain/light chain pair mentioned above typically are aligned by the framework regions to form a structure that binds specifically with a specific epitope on the target protein (e.g., PCSK9). From N-terminal to C-terminal, naturally-occurring light and heavy chain variable regions both typically conform with the following order of these elements: FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3 and FR4. A numbering system has been devised for assigning numbers to amino acids that occupy positions in each of these domains. This numbering system is defined in Kabat Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest (1987 and 1991, NIH, Bethesda, Md.), or Chothia & Lesk, 1987, J. Mol. Biol. 196:901-917; Chothia et al., 1989, Nature 342:878-883.    Various heavy chain and light chain variable regions are provided herein and are depicted in FIGS. 2A-3JJ and 3LL-3BBB. In some embodiments, each of these variable regions can be attached to the above heavy and light chain constant regions to form a complete antibody heavy and light chain, respectively. Further, each of the so generated heavy and light chain sequences can be combined to form a complete antibody structure.    Specific examples of some of the variable regions of the light and heavy chains of the antibodies that are provided and their corresponding amino acid sequences are summarized in TABLE 2.    TABLE-US-00002 TABLE 2 Exemplary Heavy and Light Chain Variable Regions Light/Heavy Antibody SEQ ID NO 30A4 5/74 3C4 7/85 23B5 9/71 25G4 10/72 31H4 12/67 27B2 13/87 25A7 15/58 27H5 16/52 26H5 17/51 31D1 18/53 20D10 19/48 27E7 20/54 30B9 21/55 19H9 22/56 26E10 23/49 21B12 23/49 17C2 24/57 23G1 26/50 13H1 28/91 9C9 30/64 9H6 31/62 31A4 32/89 1A12 33/65 16F12 35/79 22E2 36/80 27A6 37/76 28B12 38/77 28D6 39/78 31G11 40/83 13B5 42/69 31B12 44/81 3B6 46/60    Again, each of the exemplary variable heavy chains listed in Table 2 can be combined with any of the exemplary variable light chains shown in Table 2 to form an antibody. Table 2 shows exemplary light and heavy chain pairings found in several of the antibodies disclosed herein. In some instances, the antibodies include at least one variable heavy chain and one variable light chain from those listed in Table 2. In other instances, the antibodies contain two identical light chains and two identical heavy chains. As an example, an antibody or antigen binding protein can include a heavy chain and a light chain, two heavy chains, or two light chains. In some embodiments the antigen binding protein comprises (and/or consists) of 1, 2, and/or 3 heavy and/or light CDRs from at least one of the sequences listed in Table 2 (CDRs for the sequences are outlined in FIGS. 2A-3D, and other embodiments in FIGS. 3CCC-3JJJ and 15A-15D). In some embodiments, all 6 CDRs (CDR1-3 from the light (CDRL1, CDRL2, CDRL3) and CDR1-3 from the heavy (CDRH1, CDRH2, and CDRH3)) are part of the ABP. In some embodiments, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or more CDRs are included in the ABP. In some embodiments, one heavy and one light CDR from the CDRs in the sequences in Table 2 is included in the ABP (CDRs for the sequences in table 2 are outlined in FIGS. 2A-3D). In some embodiments, additional sections (e.g., as depicted in FIG. 2A-2D, 3A-3D, and other embodiments in 3CCC-3JJJ and 15A-15D) are also included in the ABP. Examples of CDRs and FRs for the heavy and light chains noted in Table 2 are outlined in FIGS. 2A-3D (and other embodiments in FIGS. 3CCC-3JJJ and 15A-15D). Optional light chain variable sequences (including CDR1, CDR2, CDR3, FR1, FR2, FR3, and FR4) can be selected from the following: 5, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 28, 30, 31, 32, 33, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 42, 44, and 46. Optional heavy chain variable sequences (including CDR1, CDR2, CDR3, FR1, FR2, FR3, and FR4) can be selected from the following: 74, 85, 71, 72, 67, 87, 58, 52, 51, 53, 48, 54, 55, 56, 49, 57, 50, 91, 64, 62, 89, 65, 79, 80, 76, 77, 78, 83, 69, 81, and 60. In some of the entries in FIG. 2A-3D, variations of the sequences or alternative boundaries of the CDRs and FRs are identified. These alternatives are identified with a 'v1' following the ABP name. As most of these alternatives are minor in nature, only sections with differences are displayed in the table. It is understood that the remaining section of the light or heavy chain is the same as shown for the base ABP in the other panels. Thus, for example, 19H9v1 in FIG. 2C has the same FR1, CDR1, and FR2 as 19H9 in FIG. 2A as the only difference is noted in FIG. 2C. For three of the nucleic acid sequences (ABPs 26E10, 30B9, and 31B12), additional alternative nucleic acid sequences are provided in the figures. As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, no more than one such sequence need actually be used in the creation of an antibody or ABP. Indeed, in some embodiments, only one or neither of the specific heavy or light chain nucleic acids need be present.    In some embodiments, the ABP is encoded by a nucleic acid sequence that can encode any of the protein sequences in Table 2.    In some embodiments, the ABP binds selectively to the form of PCSK9 that binds to LDLR (e.g., the autocatalyzed form of the molecule). In some embodiments, the antigen binding protein does not bind to the c-terminus of the cataylytic domain (e.g., the 5. 5-10, 10-15, 15-20, 20-25, 25-30, 30-40 most amino acids in the c-terminus). In some embodiments, the antigen binding protein does not bind to the n-terminus of the catalytic domain (e.g., the 5. 5-10, 10-15, 15-20, 20-25, 25-30, 30-40 most amino acids in the n-terminus). In some embodiments, the ABP binds to amino acids within amino acids 1-100 of the mature form of PCSK9. In some embodiments, the ABP binds to amino acids within (and/or amino acid sequences consisting of) amino acids 31-100, 100-200, 31-152, 153-692, 200-300, 300-400, 452-683, 400-500, 500-600, 31-692, 31-449, and/or 600-692. In some embodiments, the ABP binds to the catalytic domain. In some embodiments, the neutralizing and/or non-neutralizing ABP binds to the prodomain. In some embodiments, the ABP binds to both the catalytic and pro domains. In some embodiments, the ABP binds to the catalytic domain so as to obstruct an area on the catalytic domain that interacts with the pro domain. In some embodiments, the ABP binds to the catalytic domain at a location or surface that the pro-domain interacts with as outlined in Piper et al. (Structure 15:1-8 (2007), the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference, including the structural representations therein). In some embodiments, the ABP binds to the catalytic domain and restricts the mobility of the prodomain. In some embodiments, the ABP binds to the catalytic domain without binding to the pro-domain. In some embodiments, the ABP binds to the catalytic domain, without binding to the pro-domain, while preventing the pro-domain from reorienting to allow PCSK9 to bind to LDLR. In some embodiments, the ABP binds in the same epitope as those surrounding residues 149-152 of the pro-domain in Piper et al. In some embodiments, the ABPs bind to the groove (as outlined in Piper et al.) on the V domain. In some embodiments, the ABPs bind to the histidine-rich patch proximal to the groove on the V domain. In some embodiments, such antibodies (that bind to the V domain) are not neutralizing. In some embodiments, antibodies that bind to the V domain are neutralizing. In some embodiments, the neutralizing ABPs prevent the binding of PCSK9 to LDLR. In some embodiments, the neturalizing ABPs, while preventing the PCSK9 degradation of LDLR, do not prevent the binding of PCSK9 to LDLR (for example ABP 31A4). In some embodiments, the ABP binds to or blocks at least one of the histidines depicted in FIG. 4 of the Piper et al. paper. In some embodiments, the ABP blocks the catalytic triad in PCSK9.    In some embodiments, the antibody binds selectively to variant PCSK9 proteins, e.g., D374Y over wild type PCSK9. In some embodiments, these antibodies bind to the variant at least twice as strongly as the wild type, and preferably 2-5, 5-10, 10-100, 100-1000, 1000-10,000 fold or more to the mutant than the wild type (as measured via a K.sub.d). In some embodiments, the antibody selectively inhibits variant D374Y PCSK9 from interacting with LDLR over wild type PCSK9's ability to interact with LDLR. In some embodiments, these antibodies block the variant's ability to bind to LDLR more strongly than the wild type's ability, e.g., at least twice as strongly as the wild type, and preferably 2-5, 5-10, 10-100, 100-1000 fold or more to the mutant than the wild type (as measured via an IC.sub.50). In some embodiments, the antibody binds to and neutralizes both wild type PCSK9 and variant forms of PCSK9, such as D374Y at similar levels. In some embodiments, the antibody binds to PCSK9 to prevent variants of LDLR from binding to PCSK9. In some embodiments, the variants of LDLR are at least 50% identical to human LDLR. It is noted that variants of LDLR are known to those of skill in the art (e.g., Brown M S et al, 'Calcium cages, acid baths and recycling receptors' Nature 388: 629-630, 1997). In some embodiments, the ABP can raise the level of effective LDLR in heterozygote familial hypercholesterolemia (where a loss-of function variant of LDLR is present).    In some embodiments, the ABP binds to (but does not block) variants of PCSK9 that are at least 50%, 50-60, 60-70, 70-80, 80-90, 90-95, 95-99, or greater percent identity to the form of PCSK9 depicted in FIG. 1A and/or FIG. 1B. In some embodiments, the ABP binds to (but does not block) variants of PCSK9 that are at least 50%, 50-60, 60-70, 70-80, 80-90, 90-95, 95-99, or greater percent identity to the mature form of PCSK9 depicted in FIG. 1A and/or FIG. 1B. In some embodiments, the ABP binds to and prevents variants of PCSK9 that are at least 50%, 50-60, 60-70, 70-80, 80-90, 90-95, 95-99, or greater percent identity to the form of PCSK9 depicted in FIG. 1A and/or FIG. 1B from interacting with LDLR. In some embodiments, the ABP binds to and prevents variants of PCSK9 that are at least 50, 50-60, 60-70, 70-80, 80-90, 90-95, 95-99, or greater percent identity to the mature form of PCSK9 depicted in FIG. 1B from interacting with LDLR. In some embodiments, the variant of PCSK9 is a human variant, such as variants at position 474, E620G, and/or E670G. In some embodiments, the amino acid at position 474 is valine (as in other humans) or threonine (as in cyno and mouse). Given the cross-reactivity data presented herein, it is believed that the present antibodies will readily bind to the above variants.    In some embodiments, the ABP binds to an epitope bound by one of the antibodies described in Table 2. In some embodiments, the antigen binding proteins bind to a specific conformational state of PCSK9 so as to prevent PCSK9 from interacting with LDLR.    Humanized Antigen Binding Proteins (e.g. Antibodies)    As described herein, an antigen binding protein to PCSK9 can comprise a humanized antibody and/or part thereof. An important practical application of such a strategy is the 'humanization' of the mouse humoral immune system.    In certain embodiments, a humanized antibody is substantially non-immunogenic in humans. In certain embodiments, a humanized antibody has substantially the same affinity for a target as an antibody from another species from which the humanized antibody is derived. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,530,101, 5,693,761; 5,693,762; 5,585,089.    In certain embodiments, amino acids of an antibody variable domain that can be modified without diminishing the native affinity of the antigen binding domain while reducing its immunogenicity are identified. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,766,886 and 5,869,619.    In certain embodiments, modification of an antibody by methods known in the art is typically designed to achieve increased binding affinity for a target and/or to reduce immunogenicity of the antibody in the recipient. In certain embodiments, humanized antibodies are modified to eliminate glycosylation sites in order to increase affinity of the antibody for its cognate antigen. See, e.g., Co et al., Mol. Immunol., 30:1361-1367 (1993). In certain embodiments, techniques such as 'reshaping,' 'hyperchimerization,' or 'veneering/resurfacing' are used to produce humanized antibodies. See, e.g., Vaswami et al., Annals of Allergy, Asthma, & Immunol. 81:105 (1998); Roguska et al., Prot. Engineer., 9:895-904 (1996); and U.S. Pat. No. 6,072,035. In certain such embodiments, such techniques typically reduce antibody immunogenicity by reducing the number of foreign residues, but do not prevent anti-idiotypic and anti-allotypic responses following repeated administration of the antibodies. Certain other methods for reducing immunogenicity are described, e.g., in Gilliland et al., J. Immunol., 62(6): 3663-71 (1999).    In certain instances, humanizing antibodies results in a loss of antigen binding capacity. In certain embodiments, humanized antibodies are 'back mutated.' In certain such embodiments, the humanized antibody is mutated to include one or more of the amino acid residues found in the donor antibody. See, e.g., Saldanha et al., Mol Immunol 36:709-19 (1999).    In certain embodiments the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of the light and heavy chain variable regions of an antibody to PCSK9 can be grafted to framework regions (FRs) from the same, or another, species. In certain embodiments, the CDRs of the light and heavy chain variable regions of an antibody to PCSK9 can be grafted to consensus human FRs. To create consensus human FRs, in certain embodiments, FRs from several human heavy chain or light chain amino acid sequences are aligned to identify a consensus amino acid sequence. In certain embodiments, the FRs of an antibody to PCSK9 heavy chain or light chain are replaced with the FRs from a different heavy chain or light chain. In certain embodiments, rare amino acids in the FRs of the heavy and light chains of an antibody to PCSK9 are not replaced, while the rest of the FR amino acids are replaced. Rare amino acids are specific amino acids that are in positions in which they are not usually found in FRs. In certain embodiments, the grafted variable regions from an antibody to PCSK9 can be used with a constant region that is different from the constant region of an antibody to PCSK9. In certain embodiments, the grafted variable regions are part of a single chain Fv antibody. CDR grafting is described, e.g., in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,180,370, 6,054,297, 5,693,762, 5,859,205, 5,693,761, 5,565,332, 5,585,089, and 5,530,101, and in Jones et al, Nature, 321: 522-525 (1986); Riechmann et al., Nature, 332: 323-327 (1988); Verhoeyen et al., Science, 239:1534-1536 (1988), Winter, FEBS Letts., 430:92-94 (1998), which are hereby incorporated by reference for any purpose.    Human Antigen Binding Proteins (e.g., Antibodies)    As described herein, an antigen binding protein that binds to PCSK9 can comprise a human (i.e., fully human) antibody and/or part thereof. In certain embodiments, nucleotide sequences encoding, and amino acid sequences comprising, heavy and light chain immunoglobulin molecules, particularly sequences corresponding to the variable regions are provided. In certain embodiments, sequences corresponding to complementarity determining regions (CDR's), specifically from CDR1 through CDR3, are provided. According to certain embodiments, a hybridoma cell line expressing such an immunoglobulin molecule is provided. According to certain embodiments, a hybridoma cell line expressing such a monoclonal antibody is provided. In certain embodiments a hybridoma cell line is selected from at least one of the cell lines described in Table 2, e.g., 21B12, 16F12 and 31H4. In certain embodiments, a purified human monoclonal antibody to human PCSK9 is provided.    One can engineer mouse strains deficient in mouse antibody production with large fragments of the human Ig loci in anticipation that such mice would produce human antibodies in the absence of mouse antibodies. Large human Ig fragments can preserve the large variable gene diversity as well as the proper regulation of antibody production and expression. By exploiting the mouse machinery for antibody diversification and selection and the lack of immunological tolerance to human proteins, the reproduced human antibody repertoire in these mouse strains can yield high affinity fully human antibodies against any antigen of interest, including human antigens. Using the hybridoma technology, antigen-specific human MAbs with the desired specificity can be produced and selected. Certain exemplary methods are described in WO 98/24893, U.S. Pat. No. 5,545,807, EP 546073, and EP 546073.    In certain embodiments, one can use constant regions from species other than human along with the human variable region(s).    The ability to clone and reconstruct megabase sized human loci in yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) and to introduce them into the mouse germline provides an approach to elucidating the functional components of very large or crudely mapped loci as well as generating useful models of human disease. Furthermore, the utilization of such technology for substitution of mouse loci with their human equivalents could provide insights into the expression and regulation of human gene products during development, their communication with other systems, and their involvement in disease induction and progression.    Human antibodies avoid some of the problems associated with antibodies that possess murine or rat variable and/or constant regions. The presence of such murine or rat derived proteins can lead to the rapid clearance of the antibodies or can lead to the generation of an immune response against the antibody by a patient. In order to avoid the utilization of murine or rat derived antibodies, fully human antibodies can be generated through the introduction of functional human antibody loci into a rodent, other mammal or animal so that the rodent, other mammal or animal produces fully human antibodies.    Humanized antibodies are those antibodies that, while initially starting off containing antibody amino acid sequences that are not human, have had at least some of these nonhuman antibody amino acid sequences replaced with human antibody sequences. This is in contrast with human antibodies, in which the antibody is encoded (or capable of being encoded) by genes possessed a human.    Antigen Binding Protein Variants    Other antibodies that are provided are variants of the ABPs listed above formed by combination or subparts of the variable heavy and variable light chains shown in Table 2 and comprise variable light and/or variable heavy chains that each have at least 50%, 50-60, 60-70, 70-80%, 80-85%, 85-90%, 90-95%, 95-97%, 97-99%, or above 99% identity to the amino acid sequences of the sequences in Table 2 (either the entire sequence or a subpart of the sequence, e.g., one or more CDR). In some instances, such antibodies include at least one heavy chain and one light chain, whereas in other instances the variant forms contain two identical light chains and two identical heavy chains (or subparts thereof). In some embodiments, the sequence comparison in FIG. 2A-3D (and 13A-13J and other embodiments in 15A-15D) can be used in order to identify sections of the antibodies that can be modified by observing those variations that impact binding and those variations that do not appear to impact binding. For example, by comparing similar sequences, one can identify those sections (e.g., particular amino acids) that can be modified and how they can be modified while still retaining (or improving) the functionality of the ABP. In some embodiments, variants of ABPs include those consensus groups and sequences depicted in FIGS. 13A, 13C, 13F, 13G, 13H, 13I and/or 13J and variations are allowed in the positions identified as variable in the figures. The CDRs shown in FIGS. 13A, 13C, 13F, and 13G were defined based upon a hybrid combination of the Chothia method (based on the location of the structural loop regions, see, e.g., 'Standard conformations for the canonical structures of immunoglobulins,' Bissan Al-Lazikani, Arthur M. Lesk and Cyrus Chothia, Journal of Molecular Biology, 273(4): 927-948, 7 November (1997)) and the Kabat method (based on sequence variability, see, e.g., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, Fifth Edition. NIH Publication No. 91-3242, Kabat et al., (1991)). Each residue determined by either method, was included in the final list of CDR residues (and is presented in FIGS. 13A, 13C, 13F, and 13G). The CDRs in FIGS. 13H, 131, and 13J were obtained by the Kabat method alone. Unless specified otherwise, the defined consensus sequences, CDRs, and FRs in FIGS. 13H-13J will define and control the noted CDRs and FRs for the referenced ABPs in FIG. 13.

In some embodiments, the antigen binding protein comprises a sequence that is at least 90%, 90-95%, and/or 95-99% identical to one or more FRs from the FRs in at least one of sequences of SEQ ID NO: 74, 85, 71, 72, 67, 87, 58, 52, 51, 53, 48, 54, 55, 56, 49, 57, 50, 91, 64, 62, 89, 65, 79, 80, 76, 77, 78, 83, 69, 81, and 60. In some embodiments, 1, 2, 3, or 4 FR (each being at least 90%, 90-95%, and/or 95-99% identical to the above sequences) is present.

In certain embodiments, an antigen binding protein comprises a light chain comprising a variable region comprising an amino acid sequence at least 95% identical to an amino acid sequence selected from at least one of the sequences of SEQ ID NO: 5, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 28, 30, 31, 32, 33, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 42, 44, and 46. In certain embodiments, an antigen binding protein comprises a light chain comprising a variable region comprising an amino acid sequence at least 99% identical to an amino acid sequence selected from at least one of the sequences of SEQ ID NO: 5, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 28, 30, 31, 32, 33, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 42, 44, and 46.    In some embodiments, the antigen binding protein comprises a sequence that is at least 90%, 90-95%, and/or 95-99% identical to one or more CDRs from the CDRs in at least one of sequences of SEQ ID NO: 5, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 28, 30, 31, 32, 33, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 42, 44, and 46.

In light of the present disclosure, a skilled artisan will be able to determine suitable variants of the ABPs as set forth herein using well-known techniques. In certain embodiments, one skilled in the art can identify suitable areas of the molecule that may be changed without destroying activity by targeting regions not believed to be important for activity. In certain embodiments, one can identify residues and portions of the molecules that are conserved among similar polypeptides. In certain embodiments, even areas that can be important for biological activity or for structure can be subject to conservative amino acid substitutions without destroying the biological activity or without adversely affecting the polypeptide structure.    Additionally, one skilled in the art can review structure-function studies identifying residues in similar polypeptides that are important for activity or structure. In view of such a comparison, one can predict the importance of amino acid residues in a protein that correspond to amino acid residues which are important for activity or structure in similar proteins. One skilled in the art can opt for chemically similar amino acid substitutions for such predicted important amino acid residues.    One skilled in the art can also analyze the three-dimensional structure and amino acid sequence in relation to that structure in similar ABPs. In view of such information, one skilled in the art can predict the alignment of amino acid residues of an antibody with respect to its three dimensional structure. In certain embodiments, one skilled in the art can choose not to make radical changes to amino acid residues predicted to be on the surface of the protein, since such residues can be involved in important interactions with other molecules. Moreover, one skilled in the art can generate test variants containing a single amino acid substitution at each desired amino acid residue. The variants can then be screened using activity assays known to those skilled in the art. Such variants can be used to gather information about suitable variants. For example, if one discovered that a change to a particular amino acid residue resulted in destroyed, undesirably reduced, or unsuitable activity, variants with such a change can be avoided. In other words, based on information gathered from such routine experiments, one skilled in the art can readily determine the amino acids where further substitutions should be avoided either alone or in combination with other mutations.    A number of scientific publications have been devoted to the prediction of secondary structure. See Moult J., Curr. Op. in Biotech., 7(4):422-427 (1996), Chou et al., Biochemistry, 13(2):222-245 (1974); Chou et al., Biochemistry, 113(2):211-222 (1974); Chou et al., Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol., 47:45-148 (1978); Chou et al., Ann. Rev. Biochem., 47:251-276 and Chou et al., Biophys. J., 26:367-384 (1979). Moreover, computer programs are currently available to assist with predicting secondary structure. One method of predicting secondary structure is based upon homology modeling. For example, two polypeptides or proteins which have a sequence identity of greater than 30%, or similarity greater than 40% often have similar structural topologies. The recent growth of the protein structural database (PDB) has provided enhanced predictability of secondary structure, including the potential number of folds within a polypeptide's or protein's structure. See Holm et al., Nucl. Acid. Res., 27(1):244-247 (1999). It has been suggested (Brenner et al., Curr. Op. Struct. Biol., 7(3):369-376 (1997)) that there are a limited number of folds in a given polypeptide or protein and that once a critical number of structures have been resolved, structural prediction will become dramatically more accurate.    Additional methods of predicting secondary structure include 'threading' (Jones, D., Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol., 7(3):377-87 (1997); Sippl et al., Structure, 4(1):15-19 (1996)), 'profile analysis' (Bowie et al., Science, 253:164-170 (1991); Gribskov et al., Meth. Enzym., 183:146-159 (1990); Gribskov et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA, 84(13):4355-4358 (1987)), and 'evolutionary linkage' (See Holm, supra (1999), and Brenner, supra (1997)).    In certain embodiments, antigen binding protein variants include glycosylation variants wherein the number and/or type of glycosylation site has been altered compared to the amino acid sequences of a parent polypeptide. In certain embodiments, protein variants comprise a greater or a lesser number of N-linked glycosylation sites than the native protein. An N-linked glycosylation site is characterized by the sequence: Asn-X-Ser or Asn-X-Thr, wherein the amino acid residue designated as X can be any amino acid residue except proline. The substitution of amino acid residues to create this sequence provides a potential new site for the addition of an N-linked carbohydrate chain. Alternatively, substitutions which eliminate this sequence will remove an existing N-linked carbohydrate chain. Also provided is a rearrangement of N-linked carbohydrate chains wherein one or more N-linked glycosylation sites (typically those that are naturally occurring) are eliminated and one or more new N-linked sites are created. Additional preferred antibody variants include cysteine variants wherein one or more cysteine residues are deleted from or substituted for another amino acid (e.g., serine) as compared to the parent amino acid sequence. Cysteine variants can be useful when antibodies must be refolded into a biologically active conformation such as after the isolation of insoluble inclusion bodies. Cysteine variants generally have fewer cysteine residues than the native protein, and typically have an even number to minimize interactions resulting from unpaired cysteines.    According to certain embodiments, amino acid substitutions are those which: (1) reduce susceptibility to proteolysis, (2) reduce susceptibility to oxidation, (3) alter binding affinity for forming protein complexes, (4) alter binding affinities, and/or (4) confer or modify other physiocochemical or functional properties on such polypeptides. According to certain embodiments, single or multiple amino acid substitutions (in certain embodiments, conservative amino acid substitutions) can be made in the naturally-occurring sequence (in certain embodiments, in the portion of the polypeptide outside the domain(s) forming intermolecular contacts). In certain embodiments, a conservative amino acid substitution typically may not substantially change the structural characteristics of the parent sequence (e.g., a replacement amino acid should not tend to break a helix that occurs in the parent sequence, or disrupt other types of secondary structure that characterizes the parent sequence). Examples of art-recognized polypeptide secondary and tertiary structures are described in Proteins, Structures and Molecular Principles (Creighton, Ed., W. H. Freeman and Company, New York (1984)); Introduction to Protein Structure (C. Branden & J. Tooze, eds., Garland Publishing, New York, N.Y. (1991)); and Thornton et al., Nature, 354:105 (1991), which are each incorporated herein by reference.    In some embodiments, the variants are variants of the nucleic acid sequences of the ABPs disclosed herein. One of skill in the art will appreciate that the above discussion can be used for identifying, evaluating, and/creating ABP protein variants and also for nucleic acid sequences that can encode for those protein variants. Thus, nucleic acid sequences encoding for those protein variants (as well as nucleic acid sequences that encode for the ABPs in Table 2, but are different from those explicitly disclosed herein) are contemplated. For example, an ABP variant can have at least 80, 80-85, 85-90, 90-95, 95-97, 97-99 or greater identity to at least one nucleic acid sequence described in SEQ ID NOs: 152, 153, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151 or at least one to six (and various combinations thereof) of the CDR(s) encoded by the nucleic acid sequences in SEQ ID NOs: 152, 153, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, I10, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, and 151.    In some embodiments, the antibody (or nucleic acid sequence encoding it) is a variant if the nucleic acid sequence that encodes the particular ABP (or the nucleic acid sequence itself) can selectively hybridize to any of the nucleic acid sequences that encode the proteins in Table 2 (such as, but not limited to SEQ ID NO: 152, 153, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, and 151) under stringent conditions. In one embodiment, suitable moderately stringent conditions include prewashing in a solution of 5.times.SSC; 0.5% SDS, 1.0 mM EDTA (pH 8:0); hybridizing at 50.degree. C., -65.degree. C., 5.times.SSC, overnight or, in the event of cross-species homology, at 45.degree. C. with 0.5.times.SSC; followed by washing twice at 65.degree. C. for 20 minutes with each of 2.times., 0.5.times. and 0.2.times.SSC containing 0.1% SDS. Such hybridizing DNA sequences are also within the scope of this invention, as are nucleotide sequences that, due to code degeneracy, encode an antibody polypeptide that is encoded by a hybridizing DNA sequence and the amino acid sequences that are encoded by these nucleic acid sequences. In some embodiments, variants of CDRs include nucleic acid sequences and the amino acid sequences encoded by those sequences, that hybridize to one or more of the CDRs within the sequences noted above (individual CDRs can readily be determined in light of FIGS. 2A-3D, and other embodiments in FIGS. 3CCC-3JJJ and 15A-15D). The phrase 'selectively hybridize' referred to in this context means to detectably and selectively bind. Polynucleotides, oligonucleotides and fragments thereof in accordance with the invention selectively hybridize to nucleic acid strands under hybridization and wash conditions that minimize appreciable amounts of detectable binding to nonspecific nucleic acids. High stringency conditions can be used to achieve selective hybridization conditions as known in the art and discussed herein. Generally, the nucleic acid sequence homology between the polynucleotides, oligonucleotides, and fragments of the invention and a nucleic acid sequence of interest will be at least 80%, and more typically with preferably increasing homologies of at least 85%, 90%, 95%, 99%, and 100%. Two amino acid sequences are homologous if there is a partial or complete identity between their sequences. For example, 85% homology means that 85% of the amino acids are identical when the two sequences are aligned for maximum matching. Gaps (in either of the two sequences being matched) are allowed in maximizing matching; gap lengths of 5 or less are preferred with 2 or less being more preferred. Alternatively and preferably, two protein sequences (or polypeptide sequences derived from them of at least 30 amino acids in length) are homologous, as this term is used herein, if they have an alignment score of at more than 5 (in standard deviation units) using the program ALIGN with the mutation data matrix and a gap penalty of 6 or greater. See Dayhoff, M. O., in Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure, pp. 101-110 (Volume 5, National Biomedical Research Foundation (1972)) and Supplement 2 to this volume, pp. 1-10. The two sequences or parts thereof are more preferably homologous if their amino acids are greater than or equal to 50% identical when optimally aligned using the ALIGN program. The term 'corresponds to' is used herein to mean that a polynucleotide sequence is homologous (i.e., is identical, not strictly evolutionarily related) to all or a portion of a reference polynucleotide sequence, or that a polypeptide sequence is identical to a reference polypeptide sequence. In contradistinction, the term 'complementary to' is used herein to mean that the complementary sequence is homologous to all or a portion of a reference polynucleotide sequence. For illustration, the nucleotide sequence 'TATAC' corresponds to a reference sequence 'TATAC' and is complementary to a reference sequence 'GTATA'.    Preparation of Antigen Binding Proteins (e.g., Antibodies)    In certain embodiments, antigen binding proteins (such as antibodies) are produced by immunization with an antigen (e.g., PCSK9). In certain embodiments, antibodies can be produced by immunization with full-length PCSK9, a soluble form of PCSK9, the catalytic domain alone, the mature form of PCSK9 shown in FIG. 1A, a splice variant form of PCSK9, or a fragment thereof. In certain embodiments, the antibodies of the invention can be polyclonal or monoclonal, and/or can be recombinant antibodies. In certain embodiments, antibodies of the invention are human antibodies prepared, for example, by immunization of transgenic animals capable of producing human antibodies (see, for example, PCT Published Application No. WO 93/12227).    In certain embodiments, certain strategies can be employed to manipulate inherent properties of an antibody, such as the affinity of an antibody for its target. Such strategies include, but are not limited to, the use of site-specific or random mutagenesis of the polynucleotide molecule encoding an antibody to generate an antibody variant. In certain embodiments, such generation is followed by screening for antibody variants that exhibit the desired change, e.g. increased or decreased affinity.    In certain embodiments, the amino acid residues targeted in mutagenic strategies are those in the CDRs. In certain embodiments, amino acids in the framework regions of the variable domains are targeted. In certain embodiments, such framework regions have been shown to contribute to the target binding properties of certain antibodies. See, e.g., Hudson, Curr. Opin. Biotech., 9:395-402 (1999) and references therein.    In certain embodiments, smaller and more effectively screened libraries of antibody variants are produced by restricting random or site-directed mutagenesis to hyper-mutation sites in the CDRs, which are sites that correspond to areas prone to mutation during the somatic affinity maturation process. See, e.g., Chowdhury & Pastan, Nature Biotech., 17: 568-572 (1999) and references therein. In certain embodiments, certain types of DNA elements can be used to identify hyper-mutation sites including, but not limited to, certain direct and inverted repeats, certain consensus sequences, certain secondary structures, and certain palindromes. For example, such DNA elements that can be used to identify hyper-mutation sites include, but are not limited to, a tetrabase sequence comprising a purine (A or G), followed by guainine (G), followed by a pyrimidine (C or T), followed by either adenosine or thymidine (A or T) (i.e., A/G-G-C/T-A/T). Another example of a DNA element that can be used to identify hyper-mutation sites is the serine codon, A-G-C/T.    Preparation of Fully Human Abps (e.g., Antibodies)    In certain embodiments, a phage display technique is used to generate monoclonal antibodies. In certain embodiments, such techniques produce fully human monoclonal antibodies. In certain embodiments, a polynucleotide encoding a single Fab or Fv antibody fragment is expressed on the surface of a phage particle. See, e.g., Hoogenboom et al., J. Mol. Biol., 227: 381 (1991); Marks et al., J Mol Biol 222: 581 (1991); U.S. Pat. No. 5,885,793. In certain embodiments, phage are 'screened' to identify those antibody fragments having affinity for target. Thus, certain such processes mimic immune selection through the display of antibody fragment repertoires on the surface of filamentous bacteriophage, and subsequent selection of phage by their binding to target. In certain such procedures, high affinity functional neutralizing antibody fragments are isolated. In certain such embodiments (discussed in more detail below), a complete repertoire of human antibody genes is created by cloning naturally rearranged human V genes from peripheral blood lymphocytes. See, e.g., Mullinax et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci (USA), 87: 8095-8099 (1990).    According to certain embodiments, antibodies of the invention are prepared through the utilization of a transgenic mouse that has a substantial portion of the human antibody producing genome inserted but that is rendered deficient in the production of endogenous, murine antibodies. Such mice, then, are capable of producing human immunoglobulin molecules and antibodies and are deficient in the production of murine immunoglobulin molecules and antibodies. Technologies utilized for achieving this result are disclosed in the patents, applications and references disclosed in the specification, herein. In certain embodiments, one can employ methods such as those disclosed in PCT Published Application No. WO 98/24893 or in Mendez et al., Nature Genetics, 15:146-156 (1997), which are hereby incorporated by reference for any purpose.    Generally, fully human monoclonal ABPs (e.g., antibodies) specific for PCSK9 can be produced as follows. Transgenic mice containing human immunoglobulin genes are immunized with the antigen of interest, e.g. PCSK9, lymphatic cells (such as B-cells) from the mice that express antibodies are obtained. Such recovered cells are fused with a myeloid-type cell line to prepare immortal hybridoma cell lines, and such hybridoma cell lines are screened and selected to identify hybridoma cell lines that produce antibodies specific to the antigen of interest. In certain embodiments, the production of a hybridoma cell line that produces antibodies specific to PCSK9 is provided.    In certain embodiments, fully human antibodies are produced by exposing human splenocytes (B or T cells) to an antigen in vitro, and then reconstituting the exposed cells in an immunocompromised mouse, e.g. SCID or nod/SCID. See, e.g., Brams et al., J. Immunol. 160: 2051-2058 (1998); Carballido et al., Nat. Med., 6: 103-106 (2000). In certain such approaches, engraftment of human fetal tissue into SCID mice (SCID-hu) results in long-term hematopoiesis and human T-cell development. See, e.g., McCune et al., Science, 241:1532-1639 (1988); lfversen et al., Sem. Immunol., 8:243-248 (1996). In certain instances, humoral immune response in such chimeric mice is dependent on co-development of human T-cells in the animals. See, e.g., Martensson et al., Immunol., 83:1271-179 (1994). In certain approaches, human peripheral blood lymphocytes are transplanted into SCID mice. See, e.g., Mosier et al., Nature, 335:256-259 (1988). In certain such embodiments, when such transplanted cells are treated either with a priming agent, such as Staphylococcal Enterotoxin A (SEA), or with anti-human CD40 monoclonal antibodies, higher levels of B cell production is detected. See, e.g., Martensson et al., Immunol., 84: 224-230 (1995); Murphy et al., Blood, 86:1946-1953 (1995).    Thus, in certain embodiments, fully human antibodies can be produced by the expression of recombinant DNA in host cells or by expression in hybridoma cells. In other embodiments, antibodies can be produced using the phage display techniques described herein.    The antibodies described herein were prepared through the utilization of the XenoMouse.RTM. technology, as described herein. Such mice, then, are capable of producing human immunoglobulin molecules and antibodies and are deficient in the production of murine immunoglobulin molecules and antibodies. Technologies utilized for achieving the same are disclosed in the patents, applications, and references disclosed in the background section herein. In particular, however, a preferred embodiment of transgenic production of mice and antibodies therefrom is disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/759,620, filed Dec. 3, 1996 and International Patent Application Nos. WO 98/24893, published Jun. 11, 1998 and WO 00/76310, published Dec. 21, 2000, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference. See also Mendez et al., Nature Genetics, 15:146-156 (1997), the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.    Through the use of such technology, fully human monoclonal antibodies to a variety of antigens have been produced. Essentially, XenoMouse.RTM. lines of mice are immunized with an antigen of interest (e.g. PCSK9), lymphatic cells (such as B-cells) are recovered from the hyper-immunized mice, and the recovered lymphocytes are fused with a myeloid-type cell line to prepare immortal hybridoma cell lines. These hybridoma cell lines are screened and selected to identify hybridoma cell lines that produced antibodies specific to the antigen of interest. Provided herein are methods for the production of multiple hybridoma cell lines that produce antibodies specific to PCSK9 Further, provided herein are characterization of the antibodies produced by such cell lines, including nucleotide and amino acid sequence analyses of the heavy and light chains of such antibodies.    The production of the XenoMouse.RTM. strains of mice is further discussed and delineated in U.S. patent application Ser.

The disclosures of each of the above-cited patents, applications, and references are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.    In an alternative approach, others, including GenPharm International, Inc., have utilized a 'minilocus' approach. In the minilocus approach, an exogenous Ig locus is mimicked through the inclusion of pieces (individual genes) from the Ig locus. Thus, one or more V.sub.H genes, one or more DH genes, one or more JH genes, a mu constant region, and usually a second constant region (preferably a gamma constant region) are formed into a construct for insertion into an animal. This approach is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,545,807 to Surani et al. and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,545,806, 5,625,825, 5,625,126, 5,633,425, 5,661,016, 5,770,429, 5,789,650, 5,814,318, 5,877,397, 5,874,299, and 6,255,458 each to Lonberg & Kay, U.S. Pat.

See further Taylor et al., 1992, Chen et al., 1993, Tuaillon et al., 1993, Choi et al., 1993, Lonberg et al., (1994), Taylor et al., (1994), and Tuaillon et al., (1995), Fishwild et al., (1996), the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.    Kirin has also demonstrated the generation of human antibodies from mice in which, through microcell fusion, large pieces of chromosomes, or entire chromosomes, have been introduced. See European Patent Application Nos. 773 288 and 843 961, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference. Additionally, KM.TM. mice, which are the result of cross-breeding of Kirin's Tc mice with Medarex's minilocus (Humab) mice have been generated. These mice possess the human IgH transchromosome of the Kirin mice and the kappa chain transgene of the Genpharm mice (Ishida et al., Cloning Stem Cells, (2002) 4:91-102).    Human antibodies can also be derived by in vitro methods. Suitable examples include but are not limited to phage display (CAT, Morphosys, Dyax, Biosite/Medarex, Xoma, Symphogen, Alexion (formerly Proliferon), Affimed) ribosome display (CAT), yeast display, and the like.    In some embodiments, the antibodies described herein possess human IgG4 heavy chains as well as IgG2 heavy chains. Antibodies can also be of other human isotypes, including IgG1. The antibodies possessed high affinities, typically possessing a Kd of from about 10.sup.-6 through about 10.sup.-13 M or below, when measured by various techniques.    As will be appreciated, antibodies can be expressed in cell lines other than hybridoma cell lines. Sequences encoding particular antibodies can be used to transform a suitable mammalian host cell. Transformation can be by any known method for introducing polynucleotides into a host cell, including, for example packaging the polynucleotide in a virus (or into a viral vector) and transducing a host cell with the virus (or vector) or by transfection procedures known in the art, as exemplified by U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,399,216, 4,912,040, 4,740,461, and 4,959,455 (which patents are hereby incorporated herein by reference). The transformation procedure used depends upon the host to be transformed. Methods for introducing heterologous polynucleotides into mammalian cells are well known in the art and include dextran-mediated transfection, calcium phosphate precipitation, polybrene mediated transfection, protoplast fusion, electroporation, encapsulation of the polynucleotide(s) in liposomes, and direct microinjection of the DNA into nuclei.    Mammalian cell lines available as hosts for expression are well known in the art and include many immortalized cell lines available from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), including but not limited to Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, HeLa cells, baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells, monkey kidney cells (COS), human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (e.g., Hep G2), human epithelial kidney 293 cells, and a number of other cell lines. Cell lines of particular preference are selected through determining which cell lines have high expression levels and produce antibodies with constitutive PCSK9 binding properties.    In certain embodiments, antibodies and/or ABP are produced by at least one of the following hybridomas: 21B12, 31H4, 16F12, any the other hybridomas listed in Table 2 or disclosed in the examples. In certain embodiments, antigen binding proteins bind to PCSK9 with a dissociation constant (K.sub.D) of less than approximately 1 nM, e.g., 1000 pM to 100 pM, 100 pM to 10 pM, 10 pM to 1 pM, and/or 1 pM to 0.1 pM or less.    In certain embodiments, antigen binding proteins comprise an immunoglobulin molecule of at least one of the IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, Ig E, IgA, IgD, and IgM isotype. In certain embodiments, antigen binding proteins comprise a human kappa light chain and/or a human heavy chain. In certain embodiments, the heavy chain is of the IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgE, IgA, IgD, or IgM isotype. In certain embodiments, antigen binding proteins have been cloned for expression in mammalian cells. In certain embodiments, antigen binding proteins comprise a constant region other than any of the constant regions of the IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgE, IgA, IgD, and IgM isotype.    In certain embodiments, antigen binding proteins comprise a human lambda light chain and a human IgG2 heavy chain. In certain embodiments, antigen binding proteins comprise a human lambda light chain and a human IgG4 heavy chain. In certain embodiments, antigen binding proteins comprise a human lambda light chain and a human IgG1, IgG3, IgE, IgA, IgD or IgM heavy chain. In other embodiments, antigen binding proteins comprise a human kappa light chain and a human IgG2 heavy chain. In certain embodiments, antigen binding proteins comprise a human kappa light chain and a human IgG4 heavy chain. In certain embodiments, antigen binding proteins comprise a human kappa light chain and a human IgG1, IgG3, IgE, IgA, IgD or IgM heavy chain. In certain embodiments, antigen binding proteins comprise variable regions of antibodies ligated to a constant region that is neither the constant region for the IgG2 isotype, nor the constant region for the IgG4 isotype. In certain embodiments, antigen binding proteins have been cloned for expression in mammalian cells.    In certain embodiments, conservative modifications to the heavy and light chains of antibodies from at least one of the hybridoma lines: 21B12, 31H4 and 16F12 (and corresponding modifications to the encoding nucleotides) will produce antibodies to PCSK9 having functional and chemical characteristics similar to those of the antibodies from the hybridoma lines: 21B12, 31H4 and 16F12. In contrast, in certain embodiments, substantial modifications in the functional and/or chemical characteristics of antibodies to PCSK9 can be accomplished by selecting substitutions in the amino acid sequence of the heavy and light chains that differ significantly in their effect on maintaining (a) the structure of the molecular backbone in the area of the substitution, for example, as a sheet or helical conformation, (b) the charge or hydrophobicity of the molecule at the target site, or (c) the bulk of the side chain.    For example, a 'conservative amino acid substitution' can involve a substitution of a native amino acid residue with a normative residue such that there is little or no effect on the polarity or charge of the amino acid residue at that position. Furthermore, any native residue in the polypeptide can also be substituted with alanine, as has been previously described for 'alanine scanning mutagenesis.'    Desired amino acid substitutions (whether conservative or non-conservative) can be determined by those skilled in the art at the time such substitutions are desired. In certain embodiments, amino acid substitutions can be used to identify important residues of antibodies to PCSK9, or to increase or decrease the affinity of the antibodies to PCSK9 as described herein.    In certain embodiments, antibodies of the present invention can be expressed in cell lines other than hybridoma cell lines. In certain embodiments, sequences encoding particular antibodies can be used for transformation of a suitable mammalian host cell. According to certain embodiments, transformation can be by any known method for introducing polynucleotides into a host cell, including, for example packaging the polynucleotide in a virus (or into a viral vector) and transducing a host cell with the virus (or vector) or by transfection procedures known in the art, as exemplified by U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,399,216, 4,912,040, 4,740,461, and 4,959,455 (which patents are hereby incorporated herein by reference for any purpose). In certain embodiments, the transformation procedure used can depend upon the host to be transformed. Methods for introduction of heterologous polynucleotides into mammalian cells are well known in the art and include, but are not limited to, dextran-mediated transfection, calcium phosphate precipitation, polybrene mediated transfection, protoplast fusion, electroporation, encapsulation of the polynucleotide(s) in liposomes, and direct microinjection of the DNA into nuclei.    Mammalian cell lines available as hosts for expression are well known in the art and include, but are not limited to, many immortalized cell lines available from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), including but not limited to Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, HeLa cells, baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells, monkey kidney cells (COS), human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (e.g., Hep G2), and a number of other cell lines. In certain embodiments, cell lines can be selected through determining which cell lines have high expression levels and produce antibodies with constitutive HGF binding properties. Appropriate expression vectors for mammalian host cells are well known.    In certain embodiments, antigen binding proteins comprise one or more polypeptides. In certain embodiments, any of a variety of expression vector/host systems can be utilized to express polynucleotide molecules encoding polypeptides comprising one or more ABP components or the ABP itself. Such systems include, but are not limited to, microorganisms, such as bacteria transformed with recombinant bacteriophage, plasmid, or cosmid DNA expression vectors; yeast transformed with yeast expression vectors; insect cell systems infected with virus expression vectors (e.g., baculovirus); plant cell systems transfected with virus expression vectors (e.g., cauliflower mosaic virus, CaMV, tobacco mosaic virus, TMV) or transformed with bacterial expression vectors (e.g., Ti or pBR322 plasmid); or animal cell systems.    In certain embodiments, a polypeptide comprising one or more ABP components or the ABP itself is recombinantly expressed in yeast. Certain such embodiments use commercially available expression systems, e.g., the Pichia Expression System (Invitrogen, San Diego, Calif.), following the manufacturer's instructions. In certain embodiments, such a system relies on the pre-pro-alpha sequence to direct secretion. In certain embodiments, transcription of the insert is driven by the alcohol oxidase (AOX1) promoter upon induction by methanol.    In certain embodiments, a secreted polypeptide comprising one or more ABP components or the ABP itself is purified from yeast growth medium. In certain embodiments, the methods used to purify a polypeptide from yeast growth medium is the same as those used to purify the polypeptide from bacterial and mammalian cell supernatants.    In certain embodiments, a nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide comprising one or more ABP components or the ABP itself is cloned into a baculovirus expression vector, such as pVL1393 (PharMingen, San Diego, Calif.). In certain embodiments, such a vector can be used according to the manufacturer's directions (PharMingen) to infect Spodoptera frugiperda cells in sF9 protein-free media and to produce recombinant polypeptide. In certain embodiments, a polypeptide is purified and concentrated from such media using a heparin-Sepharose column (Pharmacia).    In certain embodiments, a polypeptide comprising one or more ABP components or the ABP itself is expressed in an insect system. Certain insect systems for polypeptide expression are well known to those of skill in the art. In one such system, Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV) is used as a vector to express foreign genes in Spodoptera frugiperda cells or in Trichoplusia larvae. In certain embodiments, a nucleic acid molecule encoding a polypeptide can be inserted into a nonessential gene of the virus, for example, within the polyhedrin gene, and placed under control of the promoter for that gene. In certain embodiments, successful insertion of a nucleic acid molecule will render the nonessential gene inactive. In certain embodiments, that inactivation results in a detectable characteristic. For example, inactivation of the polyhedrin gene results in the production of virus lacking coat protein.    In certain embodiments, recombinant viruses can be used to infect S. frugiperda cells or Trichoplusia larvae. See, e.g., Smith et al., J. Virol., 46: 584 (1983); Engelhard et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. (USA), 91: 3224-7 (1994).    In certain embodiments, polypeptides comprising one or more ABP components or the ABP itself made in bacterial cells are produced as insoluble inclusion bodies in the bacteria. In certain embodiments, host cells comprising such inclusion bodies are collected by centrifugation; washed in 0.15 M NaCl, 10 mM Tris, pH 8, 1 mM EDTA; and treated with 0.1 mg/ml lysozyme (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.) for 15 minutes at room temperature. In certain embodiments, the lysate is cleared by sonication, and cell debris is pelleted by centrifugation for 10 minutes at 12,000.times.g. In certain embodiments, the polypeptide-containing pellet is resuspended in 50 mM Tris, pH 8, and 10 mM EDTA; layered over 50% glycerol; and centrifuged for 30 minutes at 6000.times.g. In certain embodiments, that pellet can be resuspended in standard phosphate buffered saline solution (PBS) free of Mg.sup.++ and Ca.sup.++. In certain embodiments, the polypeptide is further purified by fractionating the resuspended pellet in a denaturing SDS polyacrylamide gel (See, e.g., Sambrook et al., supra). In certain embodiments, such a gel can be soaked in 0.4 M KCl to visualize the protein, which can be excised and electroeluted in gel-running buffer lacking SDS. According to certain embodiments, a Glutathione-S-Transferase (GST) fusion protein is produced in bacteria as a soluble protein. In certain embodiments, such GST fusion protein is purified using a GST Purification Module (Pharmacia).    In certain embodiments, it is desirable to 'refold' certain polypeptides, e.g., polypeptides comprising one or more ABP components or the ABP itself. In certain embodiments, such polypeptides are produced using certain recombinant systems discussed herein. In certain embodiments, polypeptides are 'refolded' and/or oxidized to form desired tertiary structure and/or to generate disulfide linkages. In certain embodiments, such structure and/or linkages are related to certain biological activity of a polypeptide. In certain embodiments, refolding is accomplished using any of a number of procedures known in the art. Exemplary methods include, but are not limited to, exposing the solubilized polypeptide agent to a pH typically above 7 in the presence of a chaotropic agent. An exemplary chaotropic agent is guanidine. In certain embodiments, the refolding/oxidation solution also contains a reducing agent and the oxidized form of that reducing agent. In certain embodiments, the reducing agent and its oxidized form are present in a ratio that will generate a particular redox potential that allows disulfide shuffling to occur. In certain embodiments, such shuffling allows the formation of cysteine bridges. Exemplary redox couples include, but are not limited to, cysteine/cystamine, glutathione/dithiobisGSH, cupric chloride, dithiothreitol DTT/dithiane DTT, and 2-mercaptoethanol (bME)/dithio-bME. In certain embodiments, a co-solvent is used to increase the efficiency of refolding. Exemplary cosolvents include, but are not limited to, glycerol, polyethylene glycol of various molecular weights, and arginine.    In certain embodiments, one substantially purifies a polypeptide comprising one or more ABP components or the ABP itself. Certain protein purification techniques are known to those of skill in the art. In certain embodiments, protein purification involves crude fractionation of polypeptide fractionations from non-polypeptide fractions. In certain embodiments, polypeptides are purified using chromatographic and/or electrophoretic techniques. Exemplary purification methods include, but are not limited to, precipitation with ammonium sulphate; precipitation with PEG; immunoprecipitation; heat denaturation followed by centrifugation; chromatography, including, but not limited to, affinity chromatography (e.g., Protein-A-Sepharose), ion exchange chromatography, exclusion chromatography, and reverse phase chromatography; gel filtration; hydroxyapatite chromatography; isoelectric focusing; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; and combinations of such and other techniques. In certain embodiments, a polypeptide is purified by fast protein liquid chromatography or by high pressure liquid chromotography (HPLC). In certain embodiments, purification steps can be changed or certain steps can be omitted, and still result in a suitable method for the preparation of a substantially purified polypeptide.    In certain embodiments, one quantitates the degree of purification of a polypeptide preparation. Certain methods for quantifying the degree of purification are known to those of skill in the art. Certain exemplary methods include, but are not limited to, determining the specific binding activity of the preparation and assessing the amount of a polypeptide within a preparation by SDS/PAGE analysis. Certain exemplary methods for assessing the amount of purification of a polypeptide preparation comprise calculating the binding activity of a preparation and comparing it to the binding activity of an initial extract. In certain embodiments, the results of such a calculation are expressed as 'fold purification.' The units used to represent the amount of binding activity depend upon the particular assay performed.    In certain embodiments, a polypeptide comprising one or more ABP components or the ABP itself is partially purified. In certain embodiments, partial purification can be accomplished by using fewer purification steps or by utilizing different forms of the same general purification scheme. For example, in certain embodiments, cation-exchange column chromatography performed utilizing an HPLC apparatus will generally result in a greater 'fold purification' than the same technique utilizing a low-pressure chromatography system. In certain embodiments, methods resulting in a lower degree of purification can have advantages in total recovery of polypeptide, or in maintaining binding activity of a polypeptide.    In certain instances, the electrophoretic migration of a polypeptide can vary, sometimes significantly, with different conditions of SDS/PAGE. See, e.g., Capaldi et al, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm., 76: 425 (1977). It will be appreciated that under different electrophoresis conditions, the apparent molecular weights of purified or partially purified polypeptide can be different.    Exemplary Epitopes    Epitopes to which anti-PCSK9 antibodies bind are provided. In some embodiments, epitopes that are bound by the presently disclosed antibodies are particularly useful. In some embodiments, antigen binding proteins that bind to any of the epitopes that are bound by the antibodies described herein are useful. In some embodiments, the epitopes bound by any of the antibodies listed in Table 2 and FIGS. 2 and 3 are especially useful. In some embodiments, the epitope is on the catalytic domain PCSK9.    In certain embodiments, a PCSK9 epitope can be utilized to prevent (e.g., reduce) binding of an anti-PCSK9 antibody or antigen binding protein to PCSK9. In certain embodiments, a PCSK9 epitope can be utilized to decrease binding of an anti-PCSK9 antibody or antigen binding protein to PCSK9. In certain embodiments, a PCSK9 epitope can be utilized to substantially inhibit binding of an anti-PCSK9 antibody or antigen binding protein to PCSK9.    In certain embodiments, a PCSK9 epitope can be utilized to isolate antibodies or antigen binding proteins that bind to PCSK9. In certain embodiments, a PCSK9 epitope can be utilized to generate antibodies or antigen binding proteins which bind to PCSK9. In certain embodiments, a PCSK9 epitope or a sequence comprising a PCSK9 epitope can be utilized as an immunogen to generate antibodies or antigen binding proteins that bind to PCSK9. In certain embodiments, a PCSK9 epitope can be administered to an animal, and antibodies that bind to PCSK9 can subsequently be obtained from the animal. In certain embodiments, a PCSK9 epitope or a sequence comprising a PCSK9 epitope can be utilized to interfere with normal PCSK9-mediated activity, such as association of PCSK9 with the LDLR.    In some embodiments, antigen binding proteins disclosed herein bind specifically to N-terminal prodomain, a subtilisin-like catalytic domain and/or a C-terminal domain. In some embodiments, the antigen binding protein binds to the substrate-binding groove of PCSK-9 (described in Cunningham et al., incorporated herein in its entirety by reference).    In some embodiments, the domain(s)/region(s) containing residues that are in contact with or are buried by an antibody can be identified by mutating specific residues in PCSK9 (e.g., a wild-type antigen) and determining whether the antigen binding protein can bind the mutated or variant PCSK9 protein. By making a number of individual mutations, residues that play a direct role in binding or that are in sufficiently close proximity to the antibody such that a mutation can affect binding between the antigen binding protein and antigen can be identified. From a knowledge of these amino acids, the domain(s) or region(s) of the antigen that contain residues in contact with the antigen binding protein or covered by the antibody can be elucidated. Such a domain can include the binding epitope of an antigen binding protein. One specific example of this general approach utilizes an arginine/glutamic acid scanning protocol (see, e.g., Nanevicz, T., et al., 1995, J. Biol. Chem., 270:37, 21619-21625 and Zupnick, A., et al., 2006, J. Biol. Chem., 281:29, 20464-20473). In general, arginine and glutamic acids are substituted (typically individually) for an amino acid in the wild-type polypeptide because these amino acids are charged and bulky and thus have the potential to disrupt binding between an antigen binding protein and an antigen in the region of the antigen where the mutation is introduced. Arginines that exist in the wild-type antigen are replaced with glutamic acid. A variety of such individual mutants are obtained and the collected binding results analyzed to determine what residues affect binding.    Example 39 describes one such arginine/glutamic acid scanning of PCSK9 for PCSK9 antigen binding proteins provided herein. A series of mutant PCSK9 antigens were created, with each mutant antigen having a single mutation. Binding of each mutant PCSK9 antigen with various PCSK9 ABPs was measured and compared to the ability of the selected ABPs to bind wild-type PCSK9 (SEQ ID NO: 303).    An alteration (for example a reduction or increase) in binding between an antigen binding protein and a variant PCSK9 as used herein means that there is a change in binding affinity (e.g., as measured by known methods such as Biacore testing or the bead based assay described below in the examples), EC.sub.50, and/or a change (for example a reduction) in the total binding capacity of the antigen binding protein (for example, as evidenced by a decrease in Bmax in a plot of antigen binding protein concentration versus antigen concentration). A significant alteration in binding indicates that the mutated residue is directly involved in binding to the antigen binding protein or is in close proximity to the binding protein when the binding protein is bound to antigen.    In some embodiments, a significant reduction in binding means that the binding affinity, EC50, and/or capacity between an antigen binding protein and a mutant PCSK9 antigen is reduced by greater than 10%, greater than 20%, greater than 40%, greater than 50%, greater than 55%, greater than 60%, greater than 65%, greater than 70%, greater than 75%, greater than 80%, greater than 85%, greater than 90% or greater than 95% relative to binding between the antigen binding protein and a wild type PCSK9 (e.g., shown in SEQ ID NO: 1 and/or SEQ ID NO: (303). In certain embodiments, binding is reduced below detectable limits. In some embodiments, a significant reduction in binding is evidenced when binding of an antigen binding protein to a variant PCSK9 protein is less than 50% (for example, less than 40%, 35%, 30%, 25%, 20%, 15% or 10%) of the binding observed between the antigen binding protein and a wild-type PCSK9 protein (for example, the protein of SEQ ID NO: 1 and/or SEQ ID NO: (303). Such binding measurements can be made using a variety of binding assays known in the art. A specific example of one such assay is described in Example 39.    In some embodiments, antigen binding proteins are provided that exhibit significantly lower binding for a variant PCSK9 protein in which a residue in a wild-type PCSK9 protein (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO: 303 is substituted with arginine or glutamic acid. In some embodiments, binding of an antigen binding protein is significantly reduced or increased for a variant PCSK9 protein having any one or more (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or 244) of the following mutations: R207E, D208R, R185E, R439E, E513R, V538R, E539R, T132R, S351R, A390R, A413R, E582R, D162R, R164E, E167R, S123R, E129R, A311R, D313R, D337R, R519E, H521R, and Q554R as compared to a wild-type PCSK9 protein (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO: 303. In the shorthand notation used here, the format is: Wild type residue: Position in polypeptide: Mutant residue, with the numbering of the residues as indicated in SEQ ID NO: lor SEQ ID NO: 303.    In some embodiments, binding of an antigen binding protein is significantly reduced or increased for a mutant PCSK9 protein having one or more (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or more) mutations at the following positions: 207, 208, 185, 181, 439, 513, 538, 539, 132, 351, 390, 413, 582, 162, 164, 167, 123, 129, 311, 313, 337, 519, 521, and 554, as shown in SEQ ID NO: 1 as compared to a wild-type PCSK9 protein (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO: 303. In some embodiments, binding of an antigen binding protein is reduced or increased for a mutant PCSK9 protein having one or more (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or more) mutations at the following positions: 207, 208, 185, 181, 439, 513, 538, 539, 132, 351, 390, 413, 582, 162, 164, 167, 123, 129, 311, 313, 337, 519, 521, and 554, as shown in SEQ ID NO: 1 as compared to a wild-type PCSK9 protein (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO: 303. In some embodiments, binding of an antigen binding protein is substantially reduced or increased for a mutant PCSK9 protein having one or more (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or more) mutations at the following positions: 207, 208, 185, 181, 439, 513, 538, 539, 132, 351, 390, 413, 582, 162, 164, 167, 123, 129, 311, 313, 337, 519, 521, and 554, within SEQ ID NO: 1 as compared to a wild-type PCSK9 protein (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO: 303.    In some embodiments, binding of an ABP is significantly reduced or increased for a mutant PCSK9 protein having one or more (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc.) of the following mutations: R207E, D208R, R185E, R439E, E513R, V538R, E539R, T132R, S351R, A390R, A413R, E582R, D162R, R164E, E167R, S123R, E129R, A311R, D313R, D337R, R519E, H521R, and Q554R within SEQ ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO: 303, as compared to a wild-type PCSK9 protein (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO: 303).    In some embodiments, binding of an ABP is significantly reduced or increased for a mutant PCSK9 protein having one or more (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc.) of the following mutations: R207E, D208R, R185E, R439E, E513R, V538R, E539R, T132R, S351R, A390R, A413R, and E582R within SEQ ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO: 303, as compared to a wild-type PCSK9 protein (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO: 303). In some embodiments, the binding is reduced. In some embodiments, the reduction in binding is observed as a change in EC50. In some embodiments, the change in EC50 is an increase in the numerical value of the EC50 (and thus is a decrease in binding).    In some embodiments, binding of an ABP is significantly reduced or increased for a mutant PCSK9 protein having one or more (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc.) of the following mutations: D162R, R164E, E167R, S123R, E129R, A311R, D313R, D337R, R519E, H521R, and Q554R within SEQ ID NO: 1, as compared to a wild-type PCSK9 protein (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO: 303). In some embodiments, the binding is reduced. In some embodiments, the reduction in binding is observed as a change in Bmax. In some embodiments, the shift in Bmax is a reduction of the maximum signal generated by the ABP. In some embodiments, for an amino acid to be part of an epitope, the Bmax is reduced by at least 10%, for example, reductions of at least any of the following amounts: 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 95, 98, 99, or 100 percent can, in some embodiments, indicate that the residue is part of the epitope.    Although the variant forms just listed are referenced with respect to the wild-type sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO: 303, it will be appreciated that in an allelic variant of PCSK9 the amino acid at the indicated position could differ. Antigen binding proteins showing significantly lower binding for such allelic forms of PCSK9 are also contemplated. Accordingly, in some embodiments, any of the above embodiments can be compared to an allelic sequence, rather than purely the wild-type sequence shown in FIG. 1A    In some embodiments, binding of an antigen binding protein is significantly reduced for a variant PCSK9 protein in which the residue at a selected position in the wild-type PCSK9 protein is mutated to any other residue. In some embodiments, the herein described arginine/glutamic acid replacements are used for the identified positions. In some embodiments, alanine is used for the identified positions.    As noted above, residues directly involved in binding or covered by an antigen binding protein can be identified from scanning results. These residues can thus provide an indication of the domains or regions of SEQ ID NO: 1 (or SEQ ID NO: 303 or SEQ ID NO: 3) that contain the binding region(s) to which antigen binding proteins bind. As can be seen from the results summarized in Example 39, in some embodiments an antigen binding protein binds to a domain containing at least one of amino acids: 207, 208, 185, 181, 439, 513, 538, 539, 132, 351, 390, 413, 582, 162, 164, 167, 123, 129, 311, 313, 337, 519, 521, and 554 of SEQ ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO: 303. In some embodiments, the antigen binding protein binds to a region containing at least one of amino acids 207, 208, 185, 181, 439, 513, 538, 539, 132, 351, 390, 413, 582, 162, 164, 167, 123, 129, 311, 313, 337, 519, 521, and 554 of SEQ ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO: 303.    In some embodiments, the antigen binding protein binds to a region containing at least one of amino acids 162, 164, 167, 207 and/or 208 of SEQ ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO: 303. In some embodiments, more than one (e.g., 2, 3, 4, or 5) of the identified residues are part of the region that is bound by the ABP. In some embodiments, the ABP competes with ABP 21B12.    In some embodiments, the antigen binding protein binds to a region containing at least one of amino acid 185 of SEQ ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO: 303. In some embodiments, the ABP competes with ABP 31H4.    In some embodiments, the antigen binding protein binds to a region containing at least one of amino acids 439, 513, 538, and/or 539 of SEQ ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO: 303. In some embodiments, more than one (e.g., 2, 3, or 4) of the identified residues are part of the region that is bound by the ABP. In some embodiments, the ABP competes with ABP 31A4.    In some embodiments, the antigen binding protein binds to a region containing at least one of amino acids 123, 129, 311, 313, 337, 132, 351, 390, and/or 413 of SEQ ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO: 303. In some embodiments, more than one (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9) of the identified residues are part of the region that is bound by the ABP. In some embodiments, the ABP competes with ABP 12H11.    In some embodiments, the antigen binding protein binds to a region containing at least one of amino acid 582, 519, 521, and/or 554 of SEQ ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO: 303. In some embodiments, more than one (e.g., 2, 3, or 4) of the identified residues are part of the region that is bound by the ABP. In some embodiments, the ABP competes with ABP 3C4.    In some embodiments, the antigen binding proteins binds to the foregoing regions within a fragment or the full length sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO: 303. In other embodiments, antigen binding proteins bind to polypeptides consisting of these regions. The reference to 'SEQ ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO: 303' denotes that one or both of these sequences can be employed or relevant. The phrase does not denote that only one should be employed.    As noted above, the above description references specific amino acid positions with reference to SEQ ID NO: 1. However, throughout the specification generally, reference is made to a Pro/Cat domain that commences at position 31, which is provided in SEQ ID NO: 3. As noted below, SEQ ID NO: 1 and SEQ ID NO: 303 lack the signal sequence of PCSK9. As such, any comparison between these various disclosures should take this difference in numbering into account. In particular, any amino acid position in SEQ ID NO: 1, will correspond to an amino acid position 30 amino acids further into the protein in SEQ ID NO: 3. For example, position 207 of SEQ ID NO: 1, corresponds to position 237 of SEQ ID NO: 3 (the full length sequence, and the numbering system used in the present specification generally). Table 39.6 outlines how the above noted positions, which reference SEQ ID NO: 1 (and/or SEQ ID NO: 303) correspond to SEQ ID NO: 3 (which includes the signal sequence). Thus, any of the above noted embodiments that are described in regard to SEQ ID NO: 1 (and/or SEQ ID NO: 303), are described in reference to SEQ ID NO: 3, by the noted corresponding positions.    In some embodiments, ABP 21B12 binds to an epitope including residues 162-167 (e.g., residues D162-E167 of SEQ ID NO: 1). In some embodiments, ABP 12H11 binds to an epitope that includes residues 123-132 (e.g., S123-T132 of SEQ ID NO: 1). In some embodiments, ABP 12H11 binds to an epitope that includes residues 311-313 (e.g., A311-D313 of SEQ ID NO: 1). In some embodiments, ABPs can bind to an epitope that includes any one of these strands of sequences.    Competing Antigen Binding Proteins    In another aspect, antigen binding proteins are provided that compete with one of the exemplified antibodies or functional fragments binding to the epitope described herein for specific binding to PCSK9. Such antigen binding proteins can also bind to the same epitope as one of the herein exemplified antigen binding proteins, or an overlapping epitope. Antigen binding proteins and fragments that compete with or bind to the same epitope as the exemplified antigen binding proteins are expected to show similar functional properties. The exemplified antigen binding proteins and fragments include those described above, including those with the heavy and light chains, variable region domains and CDRs included in TABLE 2 And/or FIGS. 2-3 and 15. Thus, as a specific example, the antigen binding proteins that are provided include those that compete with an antibody or antigen binding protein having:    (a) all 6 of the CDRs listed for an antibody listed in FIGS. 2-3 and 15;    (b) a VH and a VL listed for an antibody listed in Table 2; or    (c) two light chains and two heavy chains as specified for an antibody listed in Table 2.    Certain Therapeutic Uses and Pharmaceutical Compositions    In certain instances, PCSK9 activity correlates with a number of human disease states. For example, in certain instances, too much or too little PCSK9 activity correlates with certain conditions, such as hypercholesterolemia. Therefore, in certain instances, modulating PCSK9 activity can be therapeutically useful. In certain embodiments, a neutralizing antigen binding protein to PCSK9 is used to modulate at least one PCSK9 activity (e.g., binding to LDLR). Such methods can treat and/or prevent and/or reduce the risk of disorders that relate to elevated serum cholesterol levels or in which elevated cholesterol levels are relevant.    As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, in light of the present disclosure, disorders that relate to, involve, or can be influenced by varied cholesterol, LDL, or LDLR levels can be addressed by various embodiments of the antigen binding proteins. In some embodiments, a 'cholesterol related disorder' (which includes 'serum cholesterol related disorders') includes any one or more of the following: hypercholesterolemia, heart disease, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke, cardiovascular diseases, Alzheimers disease and generally dyslipidemias, which can be manifested, for example, by an elevated total serum cholesterol, elevated LDL, elevated triglycerides, elevated VLDL, and/or low HDL. Some non-limiting examples of primary and secondary dyslipidemias that can be treated using an ABP, either alone, or in combination with one or more other agents include the metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus, familial combined hyperlipidemia, familial hypertriglyceridemia, familial hypercholesterolemias, including heterozygous hypercholesterolemia, homozygous hypercholesterolemia, familial defective apoplipoprotein B-100; polygenic hypercholesterolemia; remnant removal disease, hepatic lipase deficiency; dyslipidemia secondary to any of the following: dietary indiscretion, hypothyroidism, drugs including estrogen and progestin therapy, beta-blockers, and thiazide diuretics; nephrotic syndrome, chronic renal failure, Cushing's syndrome, primary biliary cirrhosis, glycogen storage diseases, hepatoma, cholestasis, acromegaly, insulinoma, isolated growth hormone deficiency, and alcohol-induced hypertriglyceridemia. ABP can also be useful in preventing or treating atherosclerotic diseases, such as, for example, coronary heart disease, coronary artery disease, peripheral arterial disease, stroke (ischaemic and hemorrhagic), angina pectoris, or cerebrovascular disease and acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction. In some embodiments, the ABP is useful in reducing the risk of: nonfatal heart attacks, fatal and non-fatal strokes, certain types of heart surgery, hospitalization for heart failure, chest pain in patients with heart disease, and/or cardiovascular events because of established heart disease such as prior heart attack, prior heart surgery, and/or chest pain with evidence of clogged arteries. In some embodiments, the ABP and methods can be used to reduce the risk of recurrent cardiovascular events.    As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, diseases or disorders that are generally addressable (either treatable or preventable) through the use of statins can also benefit from the application of the instant antigen binding proteins. In addition, in some embodiments, disorders or disease that can benefit from the prevention of cholesterol synthesis or increased LDLR expression can also be treated by various embodiments of the antigen binding proteins. In addition, as will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, the use of the anti-PCSK9 antibodies can be especially useful in the treatment of Diabetes. Not only is Diabetes a risk factor for coronary heart disease, but insulin increases the expression of PCSK9. That is, people with Diabetes have elevated plasma lipid levels (which can be related to high PCSK9 levels) and can benefit from lowering those levels. This is generally discussed in more detail in Costet et al. ('Hepatic PCSK9 Expression is Regulated by Nutirtional Status via Insulin and Sterol Regulatiory Element-binding Protein 1C', J. Biol. Chem., 281: 6211-6218, 2006), the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference.    In some embodiments, the antigen binding protein is administered to those who have diabetes mellitus, abdominal aortic aneurysm, atherosclerosis and/or peripheral vascular disease in order to decrease their serum cholesterol levels to a safer range. In some embodiments, the antigen binding protein is administered to patients at risk of developing any of the herein described disorders. In some embodiments, the ABPs are administered to subjects that smoke, have hypertension or a familial history of early heart attacks.    In some embodiments, a subject is administered an ABP if they are at a moderate risk or higher on the 2004 NCEP treatment goals. In some embodiments, the ABP is admininstered to a subject if the subject's LDL cholesterol level is greater than 160 mg/dL. In some embodiments, the ABP is administered if the subjects LDL cholesterol level is greater than 130 (and they have a moderate or moderately high risk according to the 2004 NCEP treatment goals). In some embodiments, the ABP is administered if the subjects LDL cholesterol level is greater than 100 (and they have a high or very high risk according to the 2004 NCEP treatment goals).    A physician will be able to select an appropriate treatment indications and target lipid levels depending on the individual profile of a particular patient. One well-accepted standard for guiding treatment of hyperlipidemia is the Third Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of the High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (Adult Treatment Panel III) Final Report, National Institutes of Health, NIH Publication No. 02-5215 (2002), the printed publication of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.    In some embodiments, antigen binding proteins to PCSK9 are used to decrease the amount of PCSK9 activity from an abnormally high level or even a normal level. In some embodiments, antigen binding proteins to PCSK9 are used to treat or prevent hypercholesterolemia and/or in the preparation of medicaments therefore and/or for other cholesterol related disorders (such as those noted herein). In certain embodiments, an antigen binding protein to PCSK9 is used to treat or prevent conditions such as hypercholesterolemia in which PCSK9 activity is normal. In such conditions, for example, reduction of PCSK9 activity to below normal can provide a therapeutic effect.    In some embodiments, more than one antigen binding protein to PCSK9 is used to modulate PCSK9 activity.    In certain embodiments, methods are provided of treating a cholesterol related disorder, such as hypercholesterolemia comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of one or more antigen binding proteins to PCSK9 and another therapeutic agent.    In certain embodiments, an antigen binding protein to PCSK9 is administered alone. In certain embodiments, an antigen binding protein to PCSK9 is administered prior to the administration of at least one other therapeutic agent. In certain embodiments, an antigen binding protein to PCSK9 is administered concurrent with the administration of at least one other therapeutic agent. In certain embodiments, an antigen binding protein to PCSK9 is administered subsequent to the administration of at least one other therapeutic agent. In other embodiments, an antigen binding protein to PCSK9 is administered prior to the administration of at least one other therapeutic agent. Therapeutic agents (apart from the antigen binding protein), include, but are not limited to, at least one other cholesterol-lowering (serum and/or total body cholesterol) agent or an agent. In some embodiments, the agent increases the expression of LDLR, have been observed to increase serum HDL levels, lower LDL levels or lower triglyceride levels. Exemplary agents include, but are not limited to, statins (atorvastatin, cerivastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, mevastatin, pitavastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, simvastatin), Nicotinic acid (Niacin) (NIACOR, NIASPAN (slow release niacin), SLO-NIACIN (slow release niacin)), Fibric acid (LOPID (Gemfibrozil), TRICOR (fenofibrate), Bile acid sequestrants (QUESTRAN (cholestyramine), colesevelam (WELCHOL), COLESTID (colestipol)), Cholesterol absorption inhibitors (ZETIA (ezetimibe)), Combining nicotinic acid with statin (ADVICOR (LOVASTATIN and NIASPAN), Combining a statin with an absorption inhibitor (VYTORIN (ZOCOR and ZETIA) and/or lipid modifying agents.

In some embodiments, the ABP is combined with an agent that increases the level of LDLR protein in a subject, such as statins, certain cytokines like oncostatin M, estrogen, and/or certain herbal ingredients such as berberine. In some embodiments, the ABP is combined with an agent that increases serum cholesterol levels in a subject (such as certain anti-psycotic agents, certain HIV protease inhibitors, dietary factors such as high fructose, sucrose, cholesterol or certain fatty acids and certain nuclear receptor agonists and antagonists for RXR, RAR, LXR, FXR). In some embodiments, the ABP is combined with an agent that increases the level of PCSK9 in a subject, such as statins and/or insulin. The combination of the two can allow for the undesirable side-effects of other agents to be mitigated by the ABP. As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, in some embodiments, the ABP is combined with the other agent/compound. In some embodiments, the ABP and other agent are administered concurrently. In some embodiments, the ABP and other agent are not administered simultaneously, with the ABP being administered before or after the agent is administered. In some embodiments, the subject receives both the ABP and the other agent (that increases the level of LDLR) during a same period of prevention, occurrence of a disorder, and/or period of treatment.    Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can be administered in combination therapy, i.e., combined with other agents. In certain embodiments, the combination therapy comprises an antigen binding protein capable of binding PCSK9, in combination with at least one anti-cholesterol agent. Agents include, but are not limited to, in vitro synthetically prepared chemical compositions, antibodies, antigen binding regions, and combinations and conjugates thereof. In certain embodiments, an agent can act as an agonist, antagonist, alllosteric modulator, or toxin. In certain embodiments, an agent can act to inhibit or stimulate its target (e.g., receptor or enzyme activation or inhibition), and thereby promote increased expression of LDLR or decrease serum cholesterol levels.    In certain embodiments, an antigen binding protein to PCSK9 can be administered prior to, concurrent with, and subsequent to treatment with a cholesterol-lowering (serum and/or total cholesterol) agent. In certain embodiments, an antigen binding protein to PCSK9 can be administered prophylactically to prevent or mitigate the onset of hypercholesterolemia, heart disease, diabetes, and/or any of the cholesterol related disorder. In certain embodiments, an antigen binding protein to PCSK9 can be administered for the treatment of an existing hypercholesterolemia condition. In some embodiments, the ABP delays the onset of the disorder and/or symptoms associated with the disorder. In some embodiments, the ABP is provided to a subject lacking any sympotoms of any one of the cholesterol related disorders or a subset thereof.    In certain embodiments, an antigen binding protein to PCSK9 is used with particular therapeutic agents to treat various cholesterol related disorders, such as hypercholesterolemia. In certain embodiments, in view of the condition and the desired level of treatment, two, three, or more agents can be administered. In certain embodiments, such agents can be provided together by inclusion in the same formulation. In certain embodiments, such agent(s) and an antigen binding protein to PCSK9 can be provided together by inclusion in the same formulation. In certain embodiments, such agents can be formulated separately and provided together by inclusion in a treatment kit. In certain embodiments, such agents and an antigen binding protein to PCSK9 can be formulated separately and provided together by inclusion in a treatment kit. In certain embodiments, such agents can be provided separately. In certain embodiments, when administered by gene therapy, the genes encoding protein agents and/or an antigen binding protein to PCSK9 can be included in the same vector. In certain embodiments, the genes encoding protein agents and/or an antigen binding protein to PCSK9 can be under the control of the same promoter region. In certain embodiments, the genes encoding protein agents and/or an antigen binding protein to PCSK9 can be in separate vectors.

(Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18.sup.th Edition, A. R. Gennaro, ed., Mack Publishing Company (1995). In some embodiments, the formulation comprises PBS; 20 mM NaOAC, pH 5.2, 50 mM NaCl; and/or 10 mM NAOAC, pH 5.2, 9% Sucrose.    In certain embodiments, an antigen binding protein to PCSK9 and/or a therapeutic molecule is linked to a half-life extending vehicle known in the art. Such vehicles include, but are not limited to, polyethylene glycol, glycogen (e.g., glycosylation of the ABP), and dextran. Such vehicles are described, e.g., in U.S. application Ser. No. 09/428,082, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,660,843 and published PCT Application No. WO 99/25044, which are hereby incorporated by reference for any purpose.    In certain embodiments, the optimal pharmaceutical composition will be determined by one skilled in the art depending upon, for example, the intended route of administration, delivery format and desired dosage. See, for example, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, supra. In certain embodiments, such compositions may influence the physical state, stability, rate of in vivo release and rate of in vivo clearance of the antibodies of the invention.    In certain embodiments, the primary vehicle or carrier in a pharmaceutical composition can be either aqueous or non-aqueous in nature. For example, in certain embodiments, a suitable vehicle or carrier can be water for injection, physiological saline solution or artificial cerebrospinal fluid, possibly supplemented with other materials common in compositions for parenteral administration. In some embodiments, the saline comprises isotonic phosphate-buffered saline. In certain embodiments, neutral buffered saline or saline mixed with serum albumin are further exemplary vehicles. In certain embodiments, pharmaceutical compositions comprise Tris buffer of about pH 7.0-8.5, or acetate buffer of about pH 4.0-5.5, which can further include sorbitol or a suitable substitute therefore. In certain embodiments, a composition comprising an antigen binding protein to PCSK9, with or without at least one additional therapeutic agents, can be prepared for storage by mixing the selected composition having the desired degree of purity with optional formulation agents (Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, supra) in the form of a lyophilized cake or an aqueous solution. Further, in certain embodiments, a composition comprising an antigen binding protein to PCSK9, with or without at least one additional therapeutic agents, can be formulated as a lyophilizate using appropriate excipients such as sucrose.    In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition can be selected for parenteral delivery. In certain embodiments, the compositions can be selected for inhalation or for delivery through the digestive tract, such as orally. The preparation of such pharmaceutically acceptable compositions is within the ability of one skilled in the art.    In certain embodiments, the formulation components are present in concentrations that are acceptable to the site of administration. In certain embodiments, buffers are used to maintain the composition at physiological pH or at a slightly lower pH, typically within a pH range of from about 5 to about 8.    In certain embodiments, when parenteral administration is contemplated, a therapeutic composition can be in the form of a pyrogen-free, parenterally acceptable aqueous solution comprising a desired antigen binding protein to PCSK9, with or without additional therapeutic agents, in a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle. In certain embodiments, a vehicle for parenteral injection is sterile distilled water in which an antigen binding protein to PCSK9, with or without at least one additional therapeutic agent, is formulated as a sterile, isotonic solution, properly preserved. In certain embodiments, the preparation can involve the formulation of the desired molecule with an agent, such as injectable microspheres, bio-erodible particles, polymeric compounds (such as polylactic acid or polyglycolic acid), beads or liposomes, that can provide for the controlled or sustained release of the product which can then be delivered via a depot injection. In certain embodiments, hyaluronic acid can also be used, and can have the effect of promoting sustained duration in the circulation. In certain embodiments, implantable drug delivery devices can be used to introduce the desired molecule.    In certain embodiments, a pharmaceutical composition can be formulated for inhalation. In certain embodiments, an antigen binding protein to PCSK9, with or without at least one additional therapeutic agent, can be formulated as a dry powder for inhalation. In certain embodiments, an inhalation solution comprising an antigen binding protein to PCSK9, with or without at least one additional therapeutic agent, can be formulated with a propellant for aerosol delivery. In certain embodiments, solutions can be nebulized. Pulmonary administration is further described in PCT application no. PCT/US94/001875, which describes pulmonary delivery of chemically modified proteins.    In certain embodiments, it is contemplated that formulations can be administered orally. In certain embodiments, an antigen binding protein to PCSK9, with or without at least one additional therapeutic agents, that is administered in this fashion can be formulated with or without those carriers customarily used in the compounding of solid dosage forms such as tablets and capsules. In certain embodiments, a capsule can be designed to release the active portion of the formulation at the point in the gastrointestinal tract when bioavailability is maximized and pre-systemic degradation is minimized. In certain embodiments, at least one additional agent can be included to facilitate absorption of an antigen binding protein to PCSK9 and/or any additional therapeutic agents. In certain embodiments, diluents, flavorings, low melting point waxes, vegetable oils, lubricants, suspending agents, tablet disintegrating agents, and binders can also be employed.    In certain embodiments, a pharmaceutical composition can involve an effective quantity of an antigen binding protein to PCSK9, with or without at least one additional therapeutic agents, in a mixture with non-toxic excipients which are suitable for the manufacture of tablets. In certain embodiments, by dissolving the tablets in sterile water, or another appropriate vehicle, solutions can be prepared in unit-dose form. In certain embodiments, suitable excipients include, but are not limited to, inert diluents, such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate or bicarbonate, lactose, or calcium phosphate; or binding agents, such as starch, gelatin, or acacia; or lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, stearic acid, or talc.    Additional pharmaceutical compositions will be evident to those skilled in the art, including formulations involving antigen binding proteins to PCSK9, with or without at least one additional therapeutic agent(s), in sustained- or controlled-delivery formulations. In certain embodiments, techniques for formulating a variety of other sustained- or controlled-delivery means, such as liposome carriers, bio-erodible microparticles or porous beads and depot injections, are also known to those skilled in the art. See for example, PCT Application No. PCT/US93/00829 which describes the controlled release of porous polymeric microparticles for the delivery of pharmaceutical compositions. In certain embodiments, sustained-release preparations can include semipermeable polymer matrices in the form of shaped articles, e.g. films, or microcapsules. Sustained release matrices can include polyesters, hydrogels, polylactides (U.S. Pat. No. 3,773,919 and EP 058,481), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and gamma ethyl-L-glutamate (Sidman et al., Biopolymers, 22:547-556 (1983)), poly (2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate) (Langer et al., J. Biomed. Mater. Res., 15:167-277 (1981) and Langer, Chem. Tech., 12:98-105 (1982)), ethylene vinyl acetate (Langer et al., supra) or poly-D(-)-3-hydroxybutyric acid (EP 133,988). In certain embodiments, sustained release compositions can also include liposomes, which can be prepared by any of several methods known in the art. See, e.g., Eppstein et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 82:3688-3692 (1985); EP 036,676; EP 088,046 and EP 143,949.    The pharmaceutical composition to be used for in vivo administration typically is sterile. In certain embodiments, this can be accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes. In certain embodiments, where the composition is lyophilized, sterilization using this method can be conducted either prior to or following lyophilization and reconstitution. In certain embodiments, the composition for parenteral administration can be stored in lyophilized form or in a solution. In certain embodiments, parenteral compositions generally are placed into a container having a sterile access port, for example, an intravenous solution bag or vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle.    In certain embodiments, once the pharmaceutical composition has been formulated, it can be stored in sterile vials as a solution, suspension, gel, emulsion, solid, or as a dehydrated or lyophilized powder. In certain embodiments, such formulations can be stored either in a ready-to-use form or in a form (e.g., lyophilized) that is reconstituted prior to administration.    In certain embodiments, kits are provided for producing a single-dose administration unit. In certain embodiments, the kit can contain both a first container having a dried protein and a second container having an aqueous formulation. In certain embodiments, kits containing single and multi-chambered pre-filled syringes (e.g., liquid syringes and lyosyringes) are included.    In certain embodiments, the effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition comprising an antigen binding protein to PCSK9, with or without at least one additional therapeutic agent, to be employed therapeutically will depend, for example, upon the therapeutic context and objectives. One skilled in the art will appreciate that the appropriate dosage levels for treatment, according to certain embodiments, will thus vary depending, in part, upon the molecule delivered, the indication for which an antigen binding protein to PCSK9, with or without at least one additional therapeutic agent, is being used, the route of administration, and the size (body weight, body surface or organ size) and/or condition (the age and general health) of the patient. In certain embodiments, the clinician can titer the dosage and modify the route of administration to obtain the optimal therapeutic effect. In certain embodiments, a typical dosage can range from about 0.1 .mu.g/kg to up to about 100 mg/kg or more, depending on the factors mentioned above. In certain embodiments, the dosage can range from 0.1 .mu.g/kg up to about 100 mg/kg; or 1 .mu.g/kg up to about 100 mg/kg; or 5 .mu.g/kg up to about 100 mg/kg.    In certain embodiments, the frequency of dosing will take into account the pharmacokinetic parameters of an antigen binding protein to PCSK9 and/or any additional therapeutic agents in the formulation used. In certain embodiments, a clinician will administer the composition until a dosage is reached that achieves the desired effect. In certain embodiments, the composition can therefore be administered as a single dose, or as two or more doses (which may or may not contain the same amount of the desired molecule) over time, or as a continuous infusion via an implantation device or catheter. Further refinement of the appropriate dosage is routinely made by those of ordinary skill in the art and is within the ambit of tasks routinely performed by them. In certain embodiments, appropriate dosages can be ascertained through use of appropriate dose-response data. In some embodiments, the amount and frequency of administration can take into account the desired cholesterol level (serum and/or total) to be obtained and the subject's present cholesterol level, LDL level, and/or LDLR levels, all of which can be obtained by methods that are well known to those of skill in the art.    In certain embodiments, the route of administration of the pharmaceutical composition is in accord with known methods, e.g. orally, through injection by intravenous, intraperitoneal, intracerebral (intra-parenchymal), intracerebroventricular, intramuscular, subcutaneously, intra-ocular, intraarterial, intraportal, or intralesional routes; by sustained release systems or by implantation devices. In certain embodiments, the compositions can be administered by bolus injection or continuously by infusion, or by implantation device.    In certain embodiments, the composition can be administered locally via implantation of a membrane, sponge or another appropriate material onto which the desired molecule has been absorbed or encapsulated. In certain embodiments, where an implantation device is used, the device can be implanted into any suitable tissue or organ, and delivery of the desired molecule can be via diffusion, timed-release bolus, or continuous administration.    In certain embodiments, it can be desirable to use a pharmaceutical composition comprising an antigen binding protein to PCSK9, with or without at least one additional therapeutic agent, in an ex vivo manner. In such instances, cells, tissues and/or organs that have been removed from the patient are exposed to a pharmaceutical composition comprising an antigen binding protein to PCSK9, with or without at least one additional therapeutic agent, after which the cells, tissues and/or organs are subsequently implanted back into the patient.    In certain embodiments, an antigen binding protein to PCSK9 and/or any additional therapeutic agents can be delivered by implanting certain cells that have been genetically engineered, using methods such as those described herein, to express and secrete the polypeptides. In certain embodiments, such cells can be animal or human cells, and can be autologous, heterologous, or xenogeneic. In certain embodiments, the cells can be immortalized. In certain embodiments, in order to decrease the chance of an immunological response, the cells can be encapsulated to avoid infiltration of surrounding tissues. In certain embodiments, the encapsulation materials are typically biocompatible, semi-permeable polymeric enclosures or membranes that allow the release of the protein product(s) but prevent the destruction of the cells by the patient's immune system or by other detrimental factors from the surrounding tissues.    Based on the ability of ABPs to significantly neutralize PCSK9 activity (as demonstrated in the Examples below), these ABPs will have therapeutic effects in treating and preventing symptoms and conditions resulting from PCSK9-mediated activity, such as hypercholesterolemia.    Diagnostic Applications    In some embodiments, the ABP is used as a diagnostic tool. The ABP can be used to assay the amount of PCSK9 present in a sample and/or subject. As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, such ABPs need not be neutralizing ABPs. In some embodiments, the diagnostic ABP is not a neutralizing ABP. In some embodiments, the diagnostic ABP binds to a different epitope than the neutralizing ABP binds to. In some embodiments, the two ABPs do not compete with one another.    In some embodiments, the ABPs disclosed herein are used or provided in an assay kit and/or method for the detection of PCSK9 in mammalian tissues or cells in order to screen/diagnose for a disease or disorder associated with changes in levels of PCSK9. The kit comprises an ABP that binds PCSK9 and means for indicating the binding of the ABP with PCSK9, if present, and optionally PCSK9 protein levels. Various means for indicating the presence of an ABP can be used. For example, fluorophores, other molecular probes, or enzymes can be linked to the ABP and the presence of the ABP can be observed in a variety of ways. The method for screening for such disorders can involve the use of the kit, or simply the use of one of the disclosed ABPs and the determination of whether the ABP binds to PCSK9 in a sample. As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, high or elevated levels of PCSK9 will result in larger amounts of the ABP binding to PCSK9 in the sample. Thus, degree of ABP binding can be used to determine how much PCSK9 is in a sample. Subjects or samples with an amount of PCSK9 that is greater than a predetermined amount (e.g., an amount or range that a person without a PCSK9 related disorder would have) can be characterized as having a PCSK9 mediated disorder. In some embodiments, the ABP is administered to a subject taking a statin, in order to determine if the statin has increased the amount of PCSK9 in the subject.    In some embodiments, the ABP is a non-neutralizing ABP and is used to determine the amount of PCSK9 in a subject receiving an ABP and/or statin treatment.    EXAMPLES    The following examples, including the experiments conducted and results achieved, are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not to be construed as limiting the present invention.    Example 1    Immunization and Titering    Generation of Anti-PCSK9 Antibodies and Hybridomas    Antibodies to the mature form of PCSK9 (depicted as the sequence in FIG. 1A, with the pro-domain underlined), were raised in XenoMouse.RTM. mice (Abgenix, Fremont, Calif.), which are mice containing human immunoglobulin genes. Two groups of XenoMouse.RTM. mice, group 1 and 2, were used to produce antibodies to PCSK9. Group 1 included mice of the XenoMouse.RTM. strain XMG2-KL, which produces fully human IgG2Kand IgG2.lamda. antibodies. Group 1 mice were immunized with human PCSK9. PCSK9 was prepared using standard recombinant techniques using the GenBank sequence as reference (NM.sub.--174936). Group 2 involved mice of the XenoMouse.RTM. strain XMG4-KL, which produce fully human IgG4.sub..kappa. and IgG4.lamda. antibodies. Group 2 mice were also immunized with human PCSK9.    The mice of both groups were injected with antigen eleven times, according to the schedule in Table 3. In the initial immunizations, each mouse was injected with a total of 10 .mu.g of antigen delivered intraperitoneally into the abdomen. Subsequent boosts are 5 ug doses and injection method is staggered between intraperitoneal injections into the abdomen and sub-cutaneous injections at the base of the tail. For intraperitoneal injections antigen is prepared as an emulsion with TiterMax.RTM. Gold (Sigma, Cat # T2684) and for subcutaneous injections antigen is mixed with Alum (aluminum phosphate) and CpG oligos. In injections 2 through 8 and 10, each mouse was injected with a total of 5 .mu.g of antigen in the adjuvant alum gel. A final injection of 5 .mu.g of antigen per mouse is delivered in Phospho buffered saline and delivered into 2 sites 50% IP into the abdomen and 50% SQ at the base of tail. The immunization programs are summarized in Table 3, shown below.

C. in 1XPBS/0.05% azide overnight. They were washed using TiterTek 3-cycle wash with RO water. Plates were blocked using 250 ul of 1XPBS/1% milk and incubated for at least 30 minutes at RT. Block was washed off using TiterTek 3-cycle wash with RO water. One then captured b-human PCSK9 @ 2 ug/ml in 1XPBS/1% milk/10 mM Ca.sup.2+ (assay diluent) 50 ul/well and incubated for 1 hr at RT. One then washed using TiterTek 3-cycle wash with RO water. For the primary antibody, sera was titrated 1:3 in duplicate from 1:100. This was done in assay diluent 50 ul/well and incubated for 1 hr at RT. One then washed using TiterTek 3-cycle wash with RO water. The secondary antibody was goat anti Human IgG Fc HRP @ 400 ng/ml in assay diluent at 50 ul/well. This was incubated for 1 hr at RT. This was then washed using TiterTek 3-cycle wash with RO water and patted dry on paper towels. For the substrate, one-step TMB solution (Neogen, Lexington, Ky.) was used (50 ul/well) and it was allowed to develop for 30 min at RT.    The protocols followed in the ELISA assays was as follows: For samples comprising b-PCSK9 with no V5H is tag the following protocol was employed: Costar 3368 medium binding plates (Corning Life Sciences) were employed. The plates were coated with neutravadin at 8 .mu.g/ml in 1XPBS/0.05% Azide, (50 .mu.l/well). The plates were incubated at 4.degree. C. overnight. The plates were then washed using a Titertek M384 plate washer (Titertek, Huntsville, Ala.). A 3-cycle wash was perfomed. The plates were blocked with 250 .mu.l of 1XPBS/1% milk and incubated approximately 30 minutes at room temperature. The plates were then washed using the M384 plate washer. A 3-cycle wash was perfomed. The capture was b-hu PCSK9, without a V5 tag, and was added at 2 .mu.g/ml in 1XPBS/1% milk/10 mM Ca.sup.2+ (40 .mu.l/well). The plates were then incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. A 3-cycle wash was perfomed. Sera were titrated 1:3 in duplicate from 1:100, and row H was blank for sera. The titration was done in assay diluent, at a volume of 50 .mu.l/well. The plates were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. Next, a 3-cycle wash was perfomed. Goat anti Human IgG Fc HRP at 100 ng/ml (1:4000) in 1XPBS/1% milk/10 mM Ca.sup.2+ (50 .mu.l/well) was added to the plate and was incubated 1 hour at room temperature. The plates were washed once again, using a 3-cycle wash. The plates were then patted dry with paper towel. Finally, 1 step TMB (Neogen, Lexington, Ky.) (50 .mu.l/well) was added to the plate and was quenched with 1N hydrochloric acid (50 .mu.l/well) after 30 minutes at room temperature. OD's were read immediately at 450 nm using a Titertek plate reader.    Positive controls to detect plate bound PCSK9 were soluble LDL receptor (R&D Systems, Cat #2148LD/CF) and a polyclonal rabbit anti-PCSK9 antibody (Caymen Chemical #10007185) titrated 1:3 in duplicate from 3 .mu.g/ml in assay diluent. LDLR was detected with goat anti LDLR (R&D Systems, Cat #AF2148) and rabbit anti goat IgGFc HRP at a concentration of 400 ng/ml; the rabbit polyclonal was detected with goat anti-rabbit IgG Fc at a concentration of 400 ng/ml in assay diluent. Negative control was naive XMG2-KL and XMG4-KL sera titrated 1:3 in duplicate from 1:100 in assay diluent.    For samples comprising b-PCSK9 with a V5H is tag the following protocol was employed: Costar 3368 medium binding plates (Corning Life Sciences) were employed. The plates were coated with neutravadin at 8 .mu.g/ml in 1XPBS/0.05% Azide, (50 .mu.l/well). The plates were incubated at 4.degree. C. overnight. The plates were then washed using a Titertek M384 plate washer (Titertek, Huntsville, Ala.). A 3-cycle wash was perfomed. The plates were blocked with 250 .mu.l of 1XPBS/1% milk and incubated approximately 30 minutes at room temperature. The plates were then washed using the M384 plate washer. A 3-cycle wash was perfomed. The capture was b-hu PCSK9, with a V5 tag, and was added at 2 .mu.g/ml in 1XPBS/1% milk/10 mM Ca.sup.2+ (40 .mu.l/well). The plates were then incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. A 3-cycle wash was perfomed. Sera were titrated 1:3 in duplicate from 1:100, and row H was blank for sera. The titration was done in assay diluent, at a volume of 50 .mu.l/well. The plates were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. Next, the plates were washed using the M384 plate washer operated using a 3-cycle wash. Goat anti Human IgG Fc HRP at 400 ng/ml in 1XPBS/1% milk/10 mM Ca.sup.2+ was added at 50 .mu.l/well to the plate and the plate was incubated 1 hour at room temperature. The plates were washed once again, using a 3-cycle wash. The plates were then patted dry with paper towel. Finally, 1 step TMB (Neogen, Lexington, Ky.) (50 .mu.l/well) was added to the plate and the plate was quenched with 1N hydrochloric acid (50 .mu.l/well) after 30 minutes at room temperature. OD's were read immediately at 450 nm using a Titertek plate reader.    Positive control was LDLR, rabbit anti-PCSK9 titrated 1:3 in duplicate from 3 .mu.g/ml in assay diluent. LDLR detect with goat anti-LDLR (R&D Systems, Cat #AF2148) and rabbit anti-goat IgG Fc HRP at a concentration of 400 ng/ml; rabbit poly detected with goat anti-rabbit IgG Fc at a concentration of 400 ng/ml in assay diluent. Human anti-His 1.2,3 and anti-V5 1.7.1 titrated 1:3 in duplicate from 1 .mu.g/ml in assay diluent; both detected with goat anti-human IgG Fc HRP at a concentration of 400 ng/ml in assay diluent. Negative control was naive XMG2-KL and XMG4-KL sera titrated 1:3 in duplicate from 1:100 in assay diluent.    Titers of the antibody against human PCSK9 were tested by ELISA assay for mice immunized with soluble antigen as described. Table 4 summarizes the ELISA data and indicates that there were some mice which appeared to be specific for PCSK9. See, e.g., Table 4. Therefore, at the end of the immunization program, 10 mice (in bold in Table 4) were selected for harvest, and splenocytes and lymphocytes were isolated from the spleens and lymph nodes respectively, as described herein.

Selected immunized mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and the draining lymph nodes were harvested and pooled from each cohort. The B cells were dissociated from lymphoid tissue by grinding in DMEM to release the cells from the tissues, and the cells were suspended in DMEM. The cells were counted, and 0.9 ml DMEM per 100 million lymphocytes was added to the cell pellet to resuspend the cells gently but completely.    Lymphocytes were mixed with nonsecretory myeloma P3X63Ag8.653 cells purchased from ATCC, cat.# CRL1580 (Kearney et al., (1979) J. Immunol. 123, 1548-1550) at a ratio of 1:4. The cell mixture was gently pelleted by centrifugation at 400.times.g 4 min. After decanting of the supernatant, the cells were gently mixed using a 1 ml pipette. Preheated PEG/DMSO solution from Sigma (cat# P7306) (1 ml per million of B-cells) was slowly added with gentle agitation over 1 min followed by 1 min of mixing. Preheated IDMEM (2 ml per million of B cells) (DMEM without glutamine, L-glutamine, pen/strep, MEM non-essential amino acids (all from Invitrogen), was then added over 2 minutes with gentle agitation. Finally preheated IDMEM (8 ml per 10.sup.6 B-cells) was added over 3 minutes.    The fused cells were spun down 400.times.g 6 min and resuspended in 20 ml selection media (DMEM (Invitrogen), 15% FBS (Hyclone), supplemented with L-glutamine, pen/strep, MEM Non-essential amino acids, Sodium Pyruvate, 2-Mercaptoethanol (all from Invitrogen), HA-Azaserine Hypoxanthine and OPI (oxaloacetate, pyruvate, bovine insulin) (both from Sigma) and IL-6 (Boehringer Mannheim)) per million B-cells. Cells were incubated for 20-30 min at 37 C. and then resuspended in 200 ml selection media and cultured for 3-4 days in T175 flask prior to 96 well plating. Thus, hybridomas that produced antigen binding proteins to PCSK9 were produced.    Example 3    Selection of PCSK9 Antibodies    The present example outlines how the various PCSK9 antigen binding proteins were characterized and selected. The binding of secreted antibodies (produced from the hybridomas produced in Examples 1 and 2) to PCSK9 was assessed. Selection of antibodies was based on binding data and inhibition of PCSK9 binding to LDLR and affinity. Binding to soluble PCSK9 was analyzed by ELISA, as described below. BIAcore.RTM. (surface plasmon resonance) was used to quantify binding affinity.    Primary Screen    A primary screen for antibodies which bind to wild-type PCSK9 was performed. The primary screen was performed on two harvests. The primary screen comprised an ELISA assay and was performed using the following protocol:    Costar 3702 medium binding 384 well plates (Corning Life Sciences) were employed. The plates were coated with neutravadin at a concentration of 4 .mu.g/ml in 1XPBS/0.05% Azide, at a volume of 40 .mu.l/well. The plates were incubated at 4.degree. C. overnight. The plates were then washed using a Titertek plate washer (Titertek, Huntsville, Ala.). A 3-cycle wash was perfomed. The plates were blocked with 90 .mu.l of 1XPBS/1% milk and incubated approximately 30 minutes at room temperature. The plates were then washed. Again, a 3-cycle wash was perfomed. The capture sample was biotinylated-PCSK9, without a V5 tag, and was added at 0.9 .mu.g/ml in 1XPBS/1% milk/10 mM Ca.sup.2+ at a volume of 40 .mu.l/well. The plates were then incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. Next, the plates were washed using the Titertek plate washer operated using a 3-cycle wash. 10 .mu.l of supernatant was transferred into 40 .mu.l of 1XPBS/1% milk/10 mM Ca.sup.2+ and incubated 1.5 hours at room temperature. Again the plates were washed using the Titertek plate washer operated using a 3-cycle wash. 40 .mu.l/well of Goat anti-Human IgG Fc POD at a concentration of 100 ng/ml (1:4000) in 1XPBS/1% milk/10 mM Ca.sup.2+ was added to the plate and was incubated 1 hour at room temperature. The plates were washed once again, using a 3-cycle wash. Finally, 40 .mu.l/well of One-step TMB (Neogen, Lexington, Ky.) was added to the plate and quenching with 40 .mu.l/well of 1N hydrochloric acid was performed after 30 minutes at room temperature. OD's were read immediately at 450 nm using a Titertek plate reader.    The primary screen resulted in a total of 3104 antigen specific hybridomas being identified from the two harvests. Based on highest ELISA OD, 1500 hybridomas per harvest were advanced for a total of 3000 positives.    Confirmatory Screen    The 3000 positives were then rescreened for binding to wild-type PCSK9 to confirm stable hybridomas were established. The screen was performed as follows: Costar 3702 medium binding 384 well plates (Corning Life Sciences) were employed. The plates were coated with neutravadin at 3 .mu.g/ml in 1XPBS/0.05% Azide at a volume of 40 .mu.l/well. The plates were incubated at 4.degree. C. overnight. The plates were then washed using a Titertek plate washer (Titertek, Huntsville, Ala.). A 3-cycle wash was perfomed. The plates were blocked with 90 .mu.l of 1XPBS/1% milk and incubated approximately 30 minutes at room temperature. The plates were then washed using the M384 plate washer. A 3-cycle wash was perfomed. The capture sample was b-PCSK9, without a V5 tag, and was added at 0.9 .mu.g/ml in 1XPBS/1% milk/10 mM Ca.sup.2+ at a volume of 40 .mu.l/well. The plates were then incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. Next, the plates were washed using a 3-cycle wash. 10 .mu.l of supernatant was transferred into 40 .mu.l of 1XPBS/1% milk/10 mM Ca.sup.2+ and incubated 1.5 hours at room temperature. Again the plates were washed using the Titertek plate washer operated using a 3-cycle wash. 40 .mu.l/well of Goat anti-Human IgG Fc POD at a concentration of 100 ng/ml (1:4000) in 1XPBS/1% milk/10 mM Ca.sup.2+ was added to the plate, and the plate was incubated 1 hour at room temperature. The plates were washed once again, using the Titertek plate washer operated using a 3-cycle wash. Finally, 40 .mu.l/well of One-step TMB (Neogen, Lexington, Ky.) was added to the plate and was quenched with 40 .mu.l/well of 1N hydrochloric acid after 30 minutes at room temperature. OD's were read immediately at 450 nm using a Titertek plate reader. A total of 2441 positives repeated in the second screen. These antibodies were then used in the subsequent screenings.    Mouse Cross-reactivity Screen    The panel of hybridomas was then screened for cross-reactivity to mouse PCSK9 to make certain that the antibodies could bind to both human and mouse PCSK9. The following protocol was employed in the cross-reactivity screen: Costar 3702 medium binding 384 well plates (Corning Life Sciences) were employed. The plates were coated with neutravadin at 3 .mu.g/ml in 1XPBS/0.05% Azide at a volume of 401/well. The plates were incubated at 4.degree. C. overnight. The plates were then washed using a Titertek plate washer (Titertek, Huntsville, Ala.). A 3-cycle wash was perfomed. The plates were blocked with 90 .mu.l of 1XPBS/1% milk and incubated approximately 30 minutes at room temperature. The plates were then washed using the Titertek plate washer. A 3-cycle wash was perfomed. The capture sample was biotinylated-mouse PCSK9, and was added at 1 .mu.g/ml in 1XPBS/1% milk/10 mM Ca.sup.2+ at a volume of 40 .mu.l/well. The plates were then incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. Next, the plates were washed using the Titertek plate washer operated using a 3-cycle wash. 50 .mu.l of supernatant was transferred to the plates and incubated 1 hour at room temperature. Again the plates were washed using a 3-cycle wash. 40 .mu.l/well of Goat anti-Human IgG Fc POD at a concentration of 100 ng/ml (1:4000) in 1XPBS/1% milk/10 mM Ca.sup.2+ was added to the plate and the plate was incubated 1 hour at room temperature. The plates were washed once again, using a 3-cycle wash. Finally, 40 .mu.l/well One-step TMB (Neogen, Lexington, Ky.) was added to the plate and was quenched with 40 .mu.l/well of 1N hydrochloric acid after 30 minutes at room temperature. OD's were read immediately at 450 nm using a Titertek plate reader. 579 antibodies were observed to cross-react with mouse PCSK9. These antibodies were then used in the subsequent screenings.    D374Y Mutant Binding Screen    The D374Y mutation in PCSK9 has been documented in the human population (e.g., Timms K M et al, 'A mutation in PCSK9 causing autosomal-dominant hypercholesterolemia in a Utah pedigree', Hum. Genet. 114: 349-353, 2004). In order to determine if the antibodies were specific for the wild type or also bound to the D374Y form of PCSK9, the samples were then screened for binding to the mutant PCSK9 sequence comprising the mutation D374Y. The protocol for the screen was as follows: Costar 3702 medium binding 384 well plates (Corning Life Sciences) were employed in the screen. The plates were coated with neutravadin at 4 .mu.g/ml in 1XPBS/0.05% Azide at a volume of 40 .mu.l/well. The plates were incubated at 4.degree. C. overnight. The plates were then washed using a Titertek plate washer (Titertek, Huntsville, Ala.). A 3-cycle wash was perfomed. The plates were blocked with 90 .mu.l of 1XPBS/1% milk and incubated approximately 30 minutes at room temperature. The plates were then washed using the Titertek plate washer. A 3-cycle wash was perfomed. The plates were coated with biotinylated human PCSK9 D374Y at a concentration of 1 .mu.g/ml in 1XPBS/1% milk/10 mMCa.sup.2+ and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. The plates were then washed using a Titertek plate washer. A 3-cycle wash was perfomed. Late exhaust hybridoma culture supernatant was diluted 1:5 in PBS/milk/Ca.sup.2+ (10 ml plus 40 ml) and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. Next, 40 .mu.l/well of rabbit anti-human PCSK9 (Cayman Chemical) and human anti-His 1.2.3 1:2 at 1 ug/ml in 1XPBS/1% milk/10 mMCa.sup.2+ was titrated onto the plates, which were then incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. The plates were then washed using a Titertek plate washer. A 3-cycle wash was perfomed. 40 .mu.l/well of Goat anti-Human IgG Fc HRP at a concentration of 100 ng/ml (1:4000) in 1XPBS/1% milk/10 mM Ca.sup.2+ was added to the plate and the plate was incubated 1 hour at room temperature. 40 .mu.l/well of Goat anti-rabbit IgG Fc HRP at a concentration of 100 ng/ml (1:4000) in 1XPBS/1% milk/10 mM Ca.sup.2+ was added to the plate and the plate was incubated 1 hour at room temperature. The plates were then washed using a Titertek plate washer. A 3-cycle wash was perfomed. Finally, 40 .mu.l/well of One-step TMB (Neogen, Lexington, Ky.) was added to the plate and was quenched with 40 .mu.l/well of 1N hydrochloric acid after 30 minutes at room temperature. OD's were read immediately at 450 nm using a Titertek plate reader. Over 96% of the positive hits on the wild-type PCSK9 also bound mutant PCSK9.    Large Scale Receptor Ligand Blocking Screen    To screen for the antibodies that block PCSK9 binding to LDLR an assay was developed using the D374Y PCSK9 mutant. The mutant was used for this assay because it has a higher binding affinity to LDLR allowing a more sensitive receptor ligand blocking assay to be developed. The following protocol was employed in the receptor ligand blocking screen: Costar 3702 medium binding 384 well plates (Corning Life Sciences) were employed in the screen. The plates were coated with goat anti-LDLR (R&D Cat #AF2148) at 2 .mu.g/ml in 1XPBS/0.05% Azide at a volume of 40 .mu.l/well. The plates were incubated at 4.degree. C. overnight. The plates were then washed using a Titertek plate washer (Titertek, Huntsville, Ala.). A 3-cycle wash was performed. The plates were blocked with 90 .mu.l of 1XPBS/1% milk and incubated approximately 30 minutes at room temperature. The plates were then washed using the Titertek plate washer. A 3-cycle wash was performed. The capture sample was LDLR (R&D, Cat #2148LD/CF), and was added at 0.4 .mu.g/ml in 1XPBS/1% milk/10 mM Ca.sup.2+ at a volume of 40 .mu.l/well. The plates were then incubated for 1 hour and 10 minutes at room temperature. Contemporaneously, 20 ng/ml of biotinylated human D374Y PCSK9 was incubated with 15 microliters of hybridoma exhaust supernatant in Nunc polypropylene plates and the exhaust supernatant concentration was diluted 1:5. The plates were then pre-incubated for about 1 hour and 30 minutes at room temperature. Next, the plates were washed using the Titertek plate washer operated using a 3-cycle wash. 50 .mu.l/well of the pre-incubated mixture was transferred onto the LDLR coated ELISA plates and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. To detect LDLR-bound b-PCSK9, 40 .mu.l/well streptavidin HRP at 500 ng/ml in assay diluent was added to the plates. The plates were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. The plates were again washed using a Titertek plate washer. A 3-cycle wash was performed. Finally, 40 .mu.l/well of One-step TMB (Neogen, Lexington, Ky.) was added to the plate and was quenched with 40 .mu.l/well of 1N hydrochloric acid after 30 minutes at room temperature. OD's were read immediately at 450 nm using a Titertek plate reader. The screen identified 384 antibodies that blocked the interaction between PCSK9 and the LDLR well, 100 antibodies blocked the interaction strongly (OD<0.3). These antibodies inhibited the binding interaction of PCSK9 and LDLR greater than 90% (greater than 90% inhibition).    Receptor Ligand Binding Assay on Blocker Subset    The receptor ligand assay was then repeated using the mutant enzyme on the 384 member subset of neutralizers identified in the first large scale receptor ligand inhibition assay. The same protocol was employed in the screen of the 384 member blocker subset assay as was done in the large scale receptor ligand blocking screen. This repeat screen confirmed the initial screening data.    This screen of the 384 member subset identified 85 antibodies that blocked interaction between the PCSK9 mutant enzyme and the LDLR greater than 90%.    Receptor Ligand Binding Assay of Blockers that Bind the Wild Type PCSK9 but not the D374Y Mutant    In the initial panel of 3000 sups there were 86 antibodies shown to specifically bind to the wild-type PCSK9 and not to the huPCSK9(D374Y) mutant. These 86 sups were tested for the ability to block wild-type PCSK9 binding to the LDLR receptor. The following protocol was employed: Costar 3702 medium binding 384 well plates (Corning Life Sciences) were employed in the screen. The plates were coated with anti-His 1.2.3 at 10 .mu.g/ml in 1XPBS/0.05% Azide at a volume of 40 .mu.l/well. The plates were incubated at 4.degree. C. overnight. The plates were then washed using a Titertek plate washer (Titertek, Huntsville, Ala.). A 3-cycle wash was perfomed. The plates were blocked with 90 .mu.l of 1XPBS/1% milk and incubated approximately 30 minutes at room temperature. The plates were then washed using the Titertek plate washer. A 3-cycle wash was perfomed. LDLR (R&D Systems, #2148LD/CF or R&D Systems, #2148LD) was added at 5 .mu.g/ml in 1XPBS/1% milk/10 mM Ca.sup.2+ at a volume of 40 .mu.l/well. The plates were then incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. Next, the plates were washed using the Titertek plate washer operated using a 3-cycle wash. Contemporaneously, biotinylated human wild-type PCSK9 was pre-incubated with hybridoma exhaust supernatant in Nunc polypropylene plates. 22 .mu.l of hybridoma sup was transferred into 33 ul of b-PCSK9 at a concentration of 583 ng/ml in 1XPBS/1% milk/10 mMCa2.sup.+, giving a final b-PCSK9 concentration=350 ng/ml and the exhaust supernatant at a final dilution of 1:2.5. The plates were pre-incubated for approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes at room temperature. 50 .mu.l/well of the preincubated mixture was transferred onto LDLR captured ELISA plates and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. The plates were then washed using the Titertek plate washer. A 3-cycle wash was perfomed. 40 .mu.l/well streptavidin HRP at 500 ng/ml in assay diluent was added to the plates. The plates were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. The plates were then washed using a Titertek plate washer. A 3-cycle wash was perfomed. Finally, 40 .mu.l/well of One-step TMB (Neogen, Lexington, Ky.) was added to the plate and was quenched with 40 .mu.l/well of 1N hydrochloric acid after 30 minutes at room temperature. OD's were read immediately at 450 nm using a Titertek plate reader.    Screening Results    Based on the results of the assays described, several hybridoma lines were identified as producing antibodies with desired interactions with PCSK9. Limiting dilution was used to isolate a manageable number of clones from each line. The clones were designated by hybridoma line number (e.g. 21B12) and clone number (e.g. 21B12.1). In general, no difference among the different clones of a particular line were detected by the functional assays described herein. In a few cases, clones were identified from a particular line that behaved differently in the functional assays, for example, 25A7.1 was found not to block PCSK9/LDLR but 25A7.3 (referred to herein as 25A7) was neutralizing. The isolated clones were each expanded in 50-100 ml of hybridoma media and allowed to grow to exhaustion, (i.e., less than about 10% cell viability). The concentration and potency of the antibodies to PCSK9 in the supernatants of those cultures were determined by ELISA and by in vitro functional testing, as described herein. As a result of the screening described herein, the hybridomas with the highest titer of antibodies to PCSK9 were identified. The selected hybridomas are shown in FIGS. 2A-3D and Table 2.    Example 4.1    Production of Human 31H4 IgG4 Antibodies from Hybridomas    This example generally describes how one of the antigen binding proteins was produced from a hybridoma line. The production work used 50 ml exhaust supernatant generation followed by protein A purification. Integra production was for scale up and was performed later. Hybridoma line 31H4 was grown in T75 flasks in 20 ml of media (Integra Media, Table 5). When the hybridoma was nearly confluent in the T75 flasks, it was transferred to an Integra flask (Integra Biosciences, Integra CL1000, cat# 90 005).    The Integra flask is a cell culture flask that is divided by a membrane into two chambers, a small chamber and a large chamber. A volume of 20-30 ml hybridoma cells at a minimum cell density of 1.times.10.sup.6 cells per ml from the 31H4 hybridoma line was placed into the small chamber of an Integra flask in Integra media (see Table 5 for components of Integra media). Integra media alone (1 L) was placed in the large chambers of the Integra flasks. The membrane separating the two chambers is permeable to small molecular weight nutrients but is impermeable to hybridoma cells and to antibodies produced by those cells. Thus, the hybridoma cells and the antibodies produced by those hybridoma cells were retained in the small chamber.    After one week, media was removed from both chambers of the Integra flask and was replaced with fresh Integra media. The collected media from the small chambers was separately retained. After a second week of growth, the media from the small chamber was again collected. The collected media from week 1 from the hybridoma line was combined with the collected media from week 2 from the hybridoma line. The resulting collected media sample from the hybridoma line was spun to remove cells and debris (15 minutes at 3000 rpm) and the resulting supernatant was filtered (0.22 um). Clarified conditioned media was loaded onto a Protein A-Sepharose column. Optionally, the media can be first concentrated and then loaded onto a Protein A Sepharose column. Non-specific bindings were removed by an extensive PBS wash. Bound antibody proteins on the Protein A column were recovered by standard acidic antibody elution from Protein A columns (such as 50 mM Citrate, pH 3.0). Aggregated antibody proteins in the Protein A Sepharose pool were removed by size exclusion chromatography or binding ion exchange chromatography on anion exchanger resin such as Q Sepharose resin. The specific IEX conditions for the 31H4 proteins are Q-Sepharose HP at pH 7.8-8.0. Antibody was eluted with a NaCl gradient of 10 mM-500 mM in 25 column volumes.

Conditioned media from transfected cells was recovered by removing cells and cell debris. Clarified conditioned media was loaded onto a Protein A-Sepharose column. Optionally, the media can first be concentrated and then loaded onto a Protein A Sepharose column. Non-specific bindings were removed by extensive PBS wash. Bound antibody proteins on the Protein A column were recovered by standard acidic antibody elution from Protein A columns (such as 50 mM citrate, pH 3.0). Aggregated antibody proteins in the Protein A Sepharose pool were removed by size exclusion chromatography or binding ion exchange chromatography on anion exchanger resin such as Q Sepharose resin. The specific IEX conditions for the 31H4 proteins are Q-Sepharose HP at pH 7.8-8.0. The antibody was eluted with a NaCl gradient of 10 mM-500 mM in 25 column volumes.    Example 5    Production of Human 21B12 IgG4 Antibodies from Hybridomas    The present example outlines how antibody 21B12 IgG4 was produced from hybridomas. Hybridoma line 21B12 was grown in T75 flasks in media (Integra Media, Table 5). When the hybridomas were nearly confluent in the T75 flasks, they were transferred to Integra flasks (Integra Biosciences, Integra CL1000, cat# 90 005).    The Integra flask is a cell culture flask that is divided by a membrane into two chambers, a small chamber and a large chamber. A volume of 20-30 ml hybridoma cells at a minimum cell density of 1.times.10.sup.6 cells per ml from the 31H4 hybridoma line was placed into the small chamber of an Integra flask in Integra media (see Table 5 for components of Integra media). Integra media alone (1 L) was placed in the large chambers of the Integra flasks. The membrane separating the two chambers is permeable to small molecular weight nutrients but is impermeable to hybridoma cells and to antibodies produced by those cells. Thus, the hybridoma cells and the antibodies produced by those hybridoma cells were retained in the small chamber. After one week, media was removed from both chambers of the Integra flask and was replaced with fresh Integra media. The collected media from the small chambers was separately retained. After a second week of growth, the media from the small chamber was again collected. The collected media from week 1 from the hybridoma line was combined with the collected media from week 2 from the hybridoma line. The resulting collected media sample from the hybridoma line was spun to remove cells and debris (15 minutes at 3000 rpm) and the resulting supernatant was filtered (0.22 .mu.m). Clarified conditioned media were loaded onto a Protein A Sepharose column. Optionally, the media are first concentrated and then loaded onto a Protein A Sepharose column. Non-specific bindings were removed by an extensive PBS wash. Bound antibody proteins on the Protein A column were recovered by standard acidic antibody elution from Protein A columns (such as 50 mM Citrate, pH 3.0). Aggregated antibody proteins in the Protein A Sepharose pool were removed by size exclusion chromatography or binding ion exchange chromatography on anion exchanger resin such as Q Sepharose resin. The specific IEX conditions for the 21B12 proteins are Q-Sepharose HP at pH 7.8-8.0. The antibody was eluted with a NaCl gradient of 10 mM-500 mM in 25 column volumes.    Example 6    Production of Human 21B12 IgG2 Antibodies from Transfected Cells    The present example outlines how 21B12 IgG2 antibodies were produced from transfected cells. Cells (293 cells for transient expression and CHO cells for stable expression) were transfected with plasmids that encode 21B12 heavy and light chains. Conditioned media from hybridoma cells were recovered by removing cells and cell debris. Clarified conditioned media were loaded onto a Protein A-Sepharose column. Optionally, the media can first be concentrated and then loaded onto a Protein A Sepharose column. Non-specific bindings were removed by extensive PBS wash. Bound antibody proteins on the Protein A column were recovered by standard acidic antibody elution from Protein A columns (50 mM Citrate, pH 3.0). Aggregated antibody proteins in the Protein A Sepharose pool were removed by size exclusion chromatography or binding ion exchange chromatography on cation exchanger resin such as SP-Sepharose resin. The specific IEX conditions for the 21B12 proteins were SP-Sepharose HP at pH 5.2. Antibodies were eluted with 25 column volumes of buffer that contains a NaCl gradient of 10 mM-500 mM in 20 mM sodium acetate buffer.    Example 7    Production of Human 16F12 IgG4 Antibodies from Hybridomas    The present example outlines how antibody 16F12 IgG4 was produced from hybridomas. Hybridoma line 16F12 was grown in T75 flasks in media (see Table 5). When the hybridomas were nearly confluent in the T75 flasks, they were transferred to Integra flasks (Integra Biosciences, Integra CL1000, cat# 90 005).    The Integra flask is a cell culture flask that is divided by a membrane into two chambers, a small chamber and a large chamber. A volume of 20-30 ml Hybridoma cells at a minimum cell density of 1.times.10.sup.6 cells per ml from the 31H4 hybridoma line was placed into the small chamber of an Integra flask in Integra media (see Table 5 for components of Integra media).

The specific IEX conditions for the 16F12 proteins are Q Sepharose HP at pH 7.8-8.0. Antibody was eluted with a NaCl gradient of 10 mM-500 mM in 25 column volumes.    Example 8    Production of Human 16F12 IgG2 Antibodies from Transfected Cells    The present example outlines how 16F12 IgG2 antibodies were produced from transfected cells.

Antibody is eluted with 25 column volumes of buffer that contains a NaCl gradient of 10 mM-500 mM in 20 mM sodium acetate buffer.    Example 9    Sequence Analysis of Antibody Heavy and Light Chains    The nucleic acid and amino acid sequences for the light and heavy chains of the above antibodies were then deteremined by Sanger (dideoxy) nucleotide sequencing. Amino acid sequences were then deduced for the nucleic acid sequences. The nucleic acid sequences for the variable domains are depicted in FIGS. 3E-3JJ.    The cDNA sequences for the lambda light chain variable regions of 31H4, 21B12, and 16F12 were determined and are disclosed as SEQ ID NOs: 153, 95, and 105 respectively.    The cDNA sequences for the heavy chain variable regions of 31H4, 21B12, and 16F12 were determined and are disclosed as SEQ ID NOs: 152, 94, and 104 respectively.    The lambda light chain constant region (SEQ ID NO: 156), and the IgG2 and IgG4 heavy chain constant regions (SEQ ID NOs: 154 and 155) are shown in FIG. 3KK.    The polypeptide sequences predicted from each of those cDNA sequences were determined. The predicted polypeptide sequences for the lambda light chain variable regions of 31H4, 21B12, and 16F12 were predicted and are disclosed as SEQ ID NOs: 12, 23, and 35 respectively, the lambda light chain constant region (SEQ ID NO: 156), the heavy chain variable regions of 31H4, 21B12, and 16F12 were predicted and are disclosed as (SEQ. ID NOs. 67, 49, and 79 respectively. The IgG2 and IgG4 heavy chain constant regions (SEQ ID NOs: 154 and 155).    The FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, FR4 divisions are shown in FIG. 2A-3D.    Based on the sequence data, the germline genes from which each heavy chain or light chain variable region was derived was determined. The identity of the germline genes are indicated next to the corresponding hybridoma line in FIGS. 2A-3D and each is represented by a unique SEQ ID NO. FIGS. 2A-3D also depict the determined amino acid sequences for additional antibodies that were characterized.    Example 8    Determination of Isoelectric Points of Three Antibodies    The theoretical pIs of the antibodies based on amino acid sequence were determined to be 7.36 for 16F12; 8.47 for 21B12; and 6.84 for 31H4.    Example 9    Characterization of Binding of Antibodies to PCSK9    Having identified a number of antibodies that bind to PCSK9, several approaches were employed to quantify and further characterize the nature of the binding. In one aspect of the study, a Biacore affinity analysis was performed. In another aspect of the study a KinExA.RTM. affinity analysis was performed. The samples and buffers employed in these studies are presented in Table 6 below.

Affinity Measurements    A BIAcore.RTM. (surface plasmon resonance device, Biacore, Inc., Piscataway, N.J.) affinity analysis of the 21B12 antibodies to PCSK9 described in this Example was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions.    Briefly, the surface plasmon resonance experiments were performed using Biacore 2000 optical biosensors (Biacore, GE Healthcare, Piscataway, N.J.). Each individual anti-PCSK9 antibody was immobilized to a research-grade CM5 biosensor chip by amine-coupling at levels that gave a maximum analyte binding response (Rmax) of no more than 200 resonance units (RU). The concentration of PCSK9 protein was varied at 2 fold intervals (the analyte) and was injected over the immobilized antibody surface (at a flow rate of 100 .mu.l/min for 1.5 minutes). Fresh HBS-P buffer (pH 7.4, 0.01 M Hepes, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.005% surfactant P-20, Biacore) supplemented with 0.01% BSA was used as binding buffer. Binding affinities of each anti-PCSK9 antibody were measured in separate experiments against each of the human, mouse, and cynomolgus monkey PCSK9 proteins at pH 7.4 (the concentrations used were 100, 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25, 3.125, and 0 nM).    In addition, the binding affinities of antibody to human PCSK9 were also measured at pH 6.0 with the pH 6.0 HBS-P buffer (pH 6.0, 0.01 M Hepes, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.005% surfactant P-20, Biacore) supplemented with 0.01% BSA. The binding signal obtained was proportional to the free PCSK9 in solution. The dissociation equilibrium constant (K.sub.D) was obtained from nonlinear regression analysis of the competition curves using a dual-curve one-site homogeneous binding model (KinExA.RTM. software, Sapidyne Instruments Inc., Boise, Id.) (n=1 for the 6.0 pH runs). Interestingly, the antibodies appeared to display a tighter binding affinity at the lower pH (where the Kd was 12.5, 7.3, and 29 pM for 31H4, 21B12, and 16F12 respectively).    Antibody binding kinetic parameters including ka (association rate constant), kd (dissociation rate constant), and K.sub.D (dissociation equilibrium constant) were determined using the BIA evaluation 3.1 computer program (BIAcore, Inc. Piscataway, N.J.). Lower dissociation equilibrium constants indicate greater affinity of the antibody for PCSK9. The K.sub.D values determined by the BIAcore.RTM. affinity analysis are presented in Table 7.1, shown below.

Affinity Measurements    A KinExA.RTM. (Sapidyne Instruments, Inc., Boise, Id.) affinity analysis of 16F12 and 31H4 was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, Reacti-Gel.TM. (6.times.) (Pierce) was pre-coated with one of human, V5-tagged cyno or His-tagged mouse PCSK9 proteins and blocked with BSA. 10 or 100 pM of either antibody 16F12 or antibody 31H4 and one of the PCSK9 proteins was then incubated with various concentrations (0.1 pM-25 nM) of PCSK9 proteins at room temperature for 8 hours before being passed through the PCSK9-coated beads. The amount of the bead-bound 16F12 or 31H4 was quantified by fluorescently (Cy5) labeled goat anti-human IgG (H+L) antibody (Jackson Immuno Research). The binding signal is proportional to the concentration of free 16F12 or 31H4 at binding equilibrium. Equilibrium dissociation constant (K.sub.D) were obtained from nonlinear regression of the two sets of competition curves using a one-site homogeneous binding model. The KinExA.RTM. Pro software was employed in the analysis. Binding curves generated in this analysis are presented as FIGS. 4A-4F.    Both the 16F12 and 31H4 antibodies showed similar affinity to human and cyno PCSK9, but approximately 10-250 fold lower affinity to mouse PCSK9. Of the two antibodies tested using the KinExA.RTM. system, antibody 31H4 showed higher affinity to both human and cyno PCSK9 with 3 and 2 pM K.sub.D respectively. 16F12 showed slightly weaker affinity at 15 pM K.sub.D to human PCSK9 and 16 pM K.sub.D to cyno PCSK9.    The results of the KinExA.RTM. affinity analysis are summarized in Table 8.1, shown below.    TABLE-US-00009 TABLE 8.1 hPCSK9 K.sub.D cPCSK mPCSK Sample (pM) 95% CI K.sub.D (pM) 95% CI K.sub.D (pM) 95% CI 16F12 15 11~22 16 14~19 223 106~410 31H4.1 3 1~5 2 1~3 500 400~620    In addition, a SDS PAGE was run to check the quality and quantity of the samples and is shown in FIG. 5A. cPCSK9 showed around 50% less on the gel and also from the active binding concentration calculated from KinExA.RTM. assay. Therefore, the K.sub.D of the mAbs to cPCSK9 was adjusted as 50% of the active cPCSK9 in the present.    A BIAcore solution equilibirium binding assay was used to measure the Kd values for ABP 21B12. 21B12.1 showed little signal using KinExA assay, therefore, biacore solution equilibrium assay was applied. Since no significant binding was observed on binding of antibodies to immobilized PCSK9 surface, 21B12 antibody was immobilized on the flow cell 4 of a CM5 chip using amine coupling with density around 7000 RU. Flow cell 3 was used as a background control. 0.3, 1, and 3 DM of human PCSK9 or cyno PCSK9 were mixed with a serial dilutions of 21B12.1 antibody samples (ranged from 0.001.about.25 nM) in PBS plus 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 0.005% P20. Binding of the free PCSK9 in the mixed solutions were measured by injecting over the 21B12.1 antibody surface. 100% PCSK9 binding signal on 21B12.1 surface was determined in the absence of mAb in the solution. A decreased PCSK9 binding response with increasing concentrations of mAb indicated that PCSK9 binding to mAb in solution, which blocked PCSK9 from binding to the immobilized peptibody surface. Plotting the PCSK9 binding signal versus mAb concentrations, K.sub.D was calculated from three sets of curves (0.3, 1 and 3 nM fixed PCSK9 concentration) using a one-site homogeneous binding model in KinExA Pro.TM. software. Although cPCSK9 has lower protein concentration observed from KinExA assay and SDS-gel, its concentration was not adjusted here since the concentration of cPCSK9 was not used for calculation of K.sub.D. The results are displayed in Table 8.2 below and in FIGS. 5B-5D. FIG. 5B depicts the results from the solution equilibrium assay at three different hPCSK9 concentrations for hPCSK9. FIG. 5C depicts a similar set of results for mPCSK9. FIG. 5D depicts the results from the above biacore capture assay.

Briefly, to determine if two antibodies belong to the same epitope bin, one of the antibodies (mAb1) was first coated onto an ELISA plate (NUNC) at 2 .mu.g/ml by overnight incubation. The plate was then washed and blocked with 3% BSA. Meanwhile, 30 ng/ml of biotinylated hPCSK9 was incubated with the second antibody (mAb2) for 2 hours at room temperature. The mixture was applied to coated mAb1 and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. The ELISA plate was then washed and incubated with Neutravidin-HRP (Pierce) at 1:5000 dilutions for 1 hour. After another wash, the plate was incubated with TMB substrate and signal was detected at 650 nm using a Titertek plate reader. Antibodies with the same binding profiles were grouped together into the same epitope bin. The results of the antibody binning studies are presented in Table 8.3.    TABLE-US-00011 TABLE 8.3 Clone Bin 21B12.2 1 31H4 3 20D10 1 25A7.1 2 25A7.3 1 23G1 1 26H5 1 31D1 1 16F12 3 28D6 3 27A6 3 31G11 3 27B2 ND 28B12 3 22E2 3 1A12.2 1 3B6 1 3C4 4 9C9 1 9H6 1 13B5 6 13H1 7 17C2 1 19H9.2 1 23B5 1 25G4 1 26E10 1 27E7 1 27H5 1 30A4 1 30B9 1 31A4 5 31B12 5    Additional examination of the epitope binning was performed using BIAcore. Three mAbs, 16F12, 21B12 and 31H4, were immobilized on flow cells 2, 3 and 4 with density around 8000 RU. 5 nM PCSK9 from human, mouse and cyno were injected over the mAb surfaces to reach around 100 to 500 RU. 10 nM mAbs were then injected over the PCSK9 surface. Binding of three mAbs to three different PCSK9 proteins over the three mAbs were then recorded.    If the two mAbs had a similar epitope on the antigen, mAb 1 will not show the binding to the antigen already bound to the mAb 2. If the two mAbs have the different epitope on the antigen, mAb1 will show the binding to the antigen bound to the mAb2. FIG. 5E depicts these epitope binning results in graph form for three mAbs on human PCSk9. A similar pattern was observed for mPCSK9 and cPCSK9. As shown in the graph, 16F12 and 31H4 appear to share a similar epitope, while 21B12 appears to have a different epitope.    Example 11    Efficacy of 31H4 and 21B12 for Blocking D374Y PCSK9/LDLR Binding    This example provides the IC50 values for two of the antibodies in blocking PCSK9 D374Y's ability to bind to LDLR. Clear 384 well plates (Costar) were coated with 2 micrograms/ml of goat anti-LDL receptor antibody (R&D Systems) diluted in buffer A (100 mM sodium cacodylate, pH 7.4). Plates were washed thoroughly with buffer A and then blocked for 2 hours with buffer B (1% milk in buffer A). After washing, plates were incubated for 1.5 hours with 0.4 micrograms/ml of LDL receptor (R&D Systems) diluted in buffer C (buffer B supplemented with 10 mM CaCl.sub.2). Concurrent with this incubation, 20 ng/ml of biotinylated D374Y PCSK9 was incubated with various concentrations of the 31H4 IgG2, 31H4 IgG4, 21B12 IgG2 or 21B12 IgG4 antibody, which was diluted in buffer A, or buffer A alone (control). The LDL receptor containing plates were washed and the biotinylated D374Y PCSK9/antibody mixture was transferred to them and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. Binding of the biotinylated D374Y to the LDL receptor was detected by incubation with streptavidin-HRP (Biosource) at 500 ng/ml in buffer C followed by TMB substrate (KPL). The signal was quenched with 1N HCl and the absorbance read at 450 nm.    The results of this binding study are shown in FIGS. 6A-6D. Summarily, IC.sub.50 values were determined for each antibody and found to be 199 pM for 31H4 IgG2 (FIG. 6A), 156 pM for 31H4 IgG4 (FIG. 6B), 170 pM for 21B12 IgG2 (FIG. 6C), and 169 pM for 21B12 IgG4 (FIG. 6D).    The antibodies also blocked the binding of wild-type PCSK9 to the LDLR in this assay.    Example 12    Cell LDL Uptake Assay    This example demonstrates the ability of various antigen binding proteins to reduce LDL uptake by cells. Human HepG2 cells were seeded in black, clear bottom 96-well plates (Costar) at a concentration of 5.times.10.sup.5 cells per well in DMEM medium (Mediatech, Inc) supplemented with 10% FBS and incubated at 37.degree. C. (5% CO.sub.2) overnight. To form the PCSK9 and antibody complex, 2 .mu.g/ml of D374Y human PCSK9 was incubated with various concentrations of antibody diluted in uptake buffer (DMEM with 1% FBS) or uptake buffer alone (control) for 1 hour at room temperature. After washing the cells with PBS, the D374Y PCSK9/antibody mixture was transferred to the cells, followed by LDL-BODIPY (Invitrogen) diluted in uptake buffer at a final concentration of 6 .mu.g/ml. After incubation for 3 hours at 37.degree. C. (5% CO2), cells were washed thoroughly with PBS and the cell fluorescence signal was detected by Safire.TM. (TECAN) at 480-520 nm (excitation) and 520-600 nm (emission).    The results of the cellular uptake assay are shown in FIGS. 7A-7D. Summarily, IC.sub.50 values were determined for each antibody and found to be 16.7 nM for 31H4 IgG2 (FIG. 7A), 13.3 nM for 31H4 IgG4 (FIG. 7B), 13.3 n1M for 21B12 IgG2 (FIG. 7C), and 18 nM for 21B12 IgG4 (FIG. 7D). These results demonstrate that the applied antigen binding proteins can reduce the effect of PCSK9 (D374Y) to block LDL updtake by cells The antibodies also blocked the effect of wild-type PCSK9 in this assay.    Example 13    Serum cholesterol Lowering Effect of the 31H4 Antibody in 6 Day Study    In order to assess total serun cholesterol (TC) lowering in wild type (WT) mice via antibody therapy against PCSK9 protein, the following procedure was performed.    Male WT mice (C57BL/6 strain, aged 9-10 weeks, 17-27 g) obtained from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Me.) were fed a normal chow (Harland-Teklad, Diet 2918) through out the duration of the experiment. Mice were administered either anti-PCSK9 antibody 31H4 (2 mg/ml in PBS) or control IgG (2 mg/ml in PBS) at a level of 10 mg/kg through the mouse's tail vein at T=0. Naive mice were also set aside as a naive control group. Dosing groups and time of sacrifice are shown in Table 9.    TABLE-US-00012 TABLE 9 Group Treatment Time point after dosing Number 1 IgG 8 hr 7 2 31H4 8 hr 7 3 IgG 24 hr 7 4 31H4 24 hr 7 5 IgG 72 hr 7 6 31H4 72 hr 7 7 IgG 144 hr 7 8 31H4 144 hr 7 9 Naive n/a 7    Mice were sacrificed with CO2 asphyxiation at the pre-determined time points shown in Table 9. Blood was collected via vena cava into eppendorf tubes and was allowed to clot at room temperature for 30 minutes. The samples were then spun down in a table top centrifuge at 12,000.times.g for 10 minutes to separate the serum. Serum total cholesterol and HDL-C were measured using Hitachi 912 clinical analyzer and Roche/Hitachi TC and HDL-C kits.    The results of the experiment are shown in FIGS. 8A-8D. Summarily, mice to which antibody 31H4 was administered showed decreased serum cholesterol levels over the course of the experiment (FIG. 8A and FIG. 8B). In addition, it is noted that the mice also showed decreased HDL levels (FIG. 8C and FIG. 8D). For FIG. 8A and FIG. 8C, the percentage change is in relation to the control IgG at the same time point (*P<0.01, # P<0.05). For FIG. 8B and FIG. 8D, the percentage change is in relation to total serum cholesterol and HDL levels measured in naive animals at t=0 hrs (*P<0.01, # P<0.05).    In respect to the lowered HDL levels, it is noted that one of skill in the art will appreciate that the decrease in HDL in mice is not indicative that an HDL decrease will occur in humans and merely further reflects that the serum cholesterol level in the organism has decreased. It is noted that mice transport the majority of serum cholesterol in high density lipoprotein (HDL) particles which is different to humans who carry most serum cholesterol on LDL particles. In mice the measurement of total serum cholesterol most closely resembles the level of serum HDL-C. Mouse HDL contains apolipoprotein E (apoE) which is a ligand for the LDL receptor (LDLR) and allows it to be cleared by the LDLR. Thus, examining HDL is an appropriate indicator for the present example, in mice (with the understanding that a decrease in HDL is not expected for humans). For example, human HDL, in contrast, does not contain apoE and is not a ligand for the LDLR. As PCSK9 antibodies increase LDLR expression in mouse, the liver can clear more HDL and therefore lowers serum HDL-C levels.    Example 14    Effect of Antibody 31H4 on LDLR Levels in a 6 Day Study    The present example demonstrates that an antigen binding protein alters the level of LDLR in a subject, as predicted, over time. A Western blot analysis was performed in order to ascertain the effect of antibody 31H4 on LDLR levels. 50-100 mg of liver tissue obtained from the sacrified mice described in Example 13 was homogenized in 0.3 ml of RIPA buffer (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) containing complete protease inhibitor (Roche). The homogenate was incubated on ice for 30 minutes and centrifuged to pellet cellular debris. Protein concentration in the supernatant was measured using BioRad protein assay reagents (BioRad laboratories). 100 .mu.g of protein was denatured at 70.degree. C. for 10 minutes and separated on 4-12% Bis-Tris SDS gradient gel (Invitrogen). Proteins were transferred to a 0.45 .mu.m PVDF membrane (Invitrogen) and blocked in washing buffer (50 mM Tris PH7.5, 150 mM NaCL, 2 mM CaCl.sub.2 and 0.05% Tween 20) containing 5% non-fat milk for 1 hour at room temperature. The blot was then probed with goat anti-mouse LDLR antibody (R&D system) 1:2000 or anti-.beta. actin (sigma) 1:2000 for 1 hour at room temperature. The blot was washed briefly and incubated with bovine anti-goat IgG-HRP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) 1:2000 or goat anti-mouse IgG-IRP (Upstate) 1:2000. After a 1 hour incubation at room temperature, the blot was washed thoroughly and immunoreactive bands were detected using ECL plus kit (Amersham biosciences). The Western blot showed an increase in LDLR protein levels in the presence of antibody 31H4, as depicted in FIG. 9.    Example 15    Serum cholesterol Lowering Effect of Antibody 31H4 in a 13 Day Study    In order to assess total serum cholesterol (TC) lowering in wild type (WT) mice via antibody therapy against PCSK9 protein in a 13 day study, the following procedure was performed.    Male WT mice (C57BL/6 strain, aged 9-10 weeks, 17-27 g) obtained from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Me.) were fed a normal chow (Harland-Teklad, Diet 2918) through out the duration of the experiment. Mice were administered either anti-PCSK9 antibody 31H4 (2 mg/ml in PBS) or control IgG (2 mg/ml in PBS) at a level of 10 mg/kg through the mouse's tail vein at T=0. Naive mice were also set aside as naive control group. Dosing groups and time of sacrifice are shown in Table 10. Animals were sacrificed and livers were extracted and prepared as in Example 13.

More specifically, animals dosed at 10 mg/kg demonstrated a 31% decrease in serum cholesterol on day 3, which gradually returned to pre-dosing levels by day 13. FIG. 10A depicts the results of this experiment. FIG. 10C depicts the results of repeating the above procedure with the 10 mg/kg dose of 31H4, and with another antibody, 16F 12, also at 1 0 mg/kg. Dosing groups and time of sacrifice are shown in Table 11.    TABLE-US-00014 TABLE 11 Group Treatment Time point after dosing Number Dose 1 IgG 24 hr 6 10 mg/kg 2 16F12 24 hr 6 10 mg/kg 3 31H4 24 hr 6 10 mg/kg 4 IgG 72 hr 6 10 mg/kg 5 16F12 72 hr 6 10 mg/kg 6 31H4 72 hr 6 10 mg/kg 7 IgG 144 hr 6 10 mg/kg 8 16F12 144 hr 6 10 mg/kg 9 31H4 144 hr 6 10 mg/kg 10 IgG 192 hr 6 10 mg/kg 11 16F12 192 hr 6 10 mg/kg 12 31H4 192 hr 6 10 mg/kg 13 IgG2 240 hr 6 10 mg/kg 14 16F12 240 hr 6 10 mg/kg 15 31H4 240 hr 6 10 mg/kg 16 IgG2 312 hr 6 10 mg/kg 17 16F12 312 hr 6 10 mg/kg 18 31H4 312 hr 6 10 mg/kg 19 Naive n/a 6 10 mg/kg    As shown in FIG. 10C both 16F12 and 31H4 resulted in significant and substantial decreases in total serum cholesterol after just a single dose and provided benefits for over a week (10 days or more). The results of the repeated 13 day study were consistent with the results of the first 13 day study, with a decrease in serum cholesterol levels of 26% on day 3 being observed. For FIG. 10A and FIG. 10B, the percentage change is in relation to the control IgG at the same time point (*P<0.01). For FIG. 10C, the percentage change is in relation to the control IgG at the same time point (*P<0.05).    Example 16    Effect of Antibody 31H4 on HDL Levels in a 13 Day Study    The HDL levels for the animals in Example 15 were also examined. HDL levels decreased in the mice. More specifically, animals dosed at 10 mg/kg demonstrated a 33% decrease in HDL levels on day 3, which gradually returned to pre-dosing levels by day 13. FIG. 10B depicts the results of the experiment. There was a decrease in HDL levels of 34% on day 3. FIG. 10B depicts the results of the repeated 13 day experiment.    As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, while the antibodies will lower mouse HDL, this is not expected to occur in humans because of the differences in HDL in humans and other organisms (such as mice). Thus, the decrease in mouse HDL is not indicative of a decrease in human HDL.    Example 17    Repeated Administration of Antibodies Produce Continued Benefits of Antigen Binding Peptides    In order to verify that the results obtained in the Examples above can be prolonged for further benefits with additional doses, the Experiments in Examples 15 and 16 were repeated with the dosing schedule depicted in FIG. 11A. The results are displayed in FIG. 11B. As can be seen in the graph in FIG. 11B, while both sets of mice displayed a significant decrease in total serum cholesterol because all of the mice received an initial injection of the 31H4 antigen binding protein, the mice that received additional injections of the 31H4 ABP displayed a continued reduction in total serum cholesterol, while those mice that only received the control injection eventually displayed an increase in their total serum cholesterol. For FIG. 11, the percentage change is in relation to the naive animals at t=0 hours (*P<0.01, **P<0.001).    The results from this example demonstrate that, unlike other cholesterol treatment methods, in which repeated applications lead to a reduction in efficacy because of biological adjustments in the subject, the present approach does not seem to suffer from this issue over the time period examined. Moreover, this suggests that the return of total serum cholesterol or HDL cholesterol levels to baseline, observed in the previous examples is not due to some resistance to the treatment being developed by the subject, but rather the depletion of the antibody availability in the subject.    Example 18    Epitope Mapping of Human Anti PCSK9 Antibodies    This example outlines methods for determining which residues in PCSK9 are involved in forming or part of the epitope for the antigen binding proteins disclosed herein to PCSK9.    In order to determine the epitopes to which certain of the ABPs of the present invention bind, the epitopes of the ABPs can be mapped using synthetic peptides derived from the specific PCSK9 peptide sequence.    A SPOTs peptide array (Sigma Genosys) can be used to study the molecular interaction of the human anti-PCSK9 antibodies with their peptide epitope. SPOTs technology is based on the solid-phase synthesis of peptides in a format suitable for the systematic analysis of antibody epitopes. Synthesis of custom arrayed oligopeptides is commerically available from Sigma-Genosys. A peptide array of overlapping oligopeptides derived from the amino-acid sequence of the PCSK9 peptide can be obtained. The array can comprise a series of 12-mer peptides as spots on a polypropylene membrane sheets. The peptide array can span the entire length of the PCSK9 mature sequence. Each consecutive peptide can be offset by 1 residue from the previous one, yielding a nested, overlapping library of arrayed oligopeptides. The membrane carrying the peptides can be reacted with different anti-PCSK9 antibodies (1 micrograms/ml). The binding of the mAbs to the membrane-bound peptides can be assessed by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using HRP-conjugated secondary antibody followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL).    In addition, functional epitopes can be mapped by combinatorial alanine scanning. In this process, a combinatorial alanine-scanning strategy can be used to identify amino acids in the PCSK9 protein that are necessary for interaction with anti-PCSK9 ABPs. To accomplish this, a second set of SPOTs arrays can be used for alanine scanning. A panel of variant peptides with alanine substitutions in each of the 12 residues can be scanned as above. This will allow for the epitopes for the ABPs to the human PCSK9 to be mapped and identified.    In the alternative, given that it is possible that the epitope is conformational, a combination of alanine scanning and/or arginine scanning, antibody FAB/PCSK9 co-crystallization, and limited proteolysis/LC-MS (liquid chromatography mass spec.) can be employed to indentify the epitopes.    Example 19    Uses of PCSK9 Antibodies for the Treatment of Cholesterol Related Disorders    A human patient exhibiting a Cholesterol Related Disorder (in which a reduction in cholesterol (such as serum cholesterol) can be beneficial) is administered a therapeutically effective amount of PCSK9 antibody, 31H4 (or, for example, 21B12 or 16F12). At periodic times during the treatment, the patient is monitored to determine whether the symptoms of the disorder has subsided. Following treatment, it is found that patients undergoing treatment with the PCSK9 antibody have reduced serum cholesterol levels, in comparison to patients that are not treated.    Example 20    Uses of PCSK9 Antibodies for the Treatment of Hypercholesterolemia    A human patient exhibiting symptoms of hypercholesterolemia is administered a therapeutcially effective amount of PCSK9 antibody, such as 31H4 (or, for example, 21B12 or 16F12). At periodic times during the treatment, the human patient is monitored to determine whether the serum cholesterol level has declined. Following treatment, it is found that the patient receiving the treatment with the PCSK9 antibodies has reduced serum cholesterol levels in comparison to arthritis patients not receiving the treatment.    Example 21    Uses of PCSK9 Antibodies for the Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease and/or Recurrent Cardiovascular Events    A human patient at risk of developing coronary haeart disease is identified. The patient is administered a therapeutically effective amount of PCSK9 antibody, such as 31H4 (or, for example, 21B12 or 16F12), either alone, concurrently or sequentially with a statin, e.g., simvastatin. At periodic times during the treatment, the human patient is monitored to determine whether the patient's total serum cholesterol level changes. Throughout the preventative treatment, it is found that the patient receiving the treatment with the PCSK9 antibodies has reduced serum cholesterol thereby reducing their risk to coronary heart disases or recurrent cardiovascular events in comparison to patients not receiving the treatment.    Example 22    Use of PCSK9 Antibodies as a Diagnostic Agent    An Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) for the detection of PCSK9 antigen in a sample can used to diagnose patients exhibiting high levels of PCSK9 production. In the assay, wells of a microtiter plate, such as a 96-well microtiter plate or a 384-well microtiter plate, are adsorbed for several hours with a first fully human monoclonal antibody directed against PCSK9. The immobilized antibody serves as a capture antibody for any of the PCSK9 that may be present in a test sample. The wells are rinsed and treated with a blocking agent such as milk protein or albumin to prevent nonspecific adsorption of the analyte.    Subsequently the wells are treated with a test sample suspected of containing the PCSK9, or with a solution containing a standard amount of the antigen. Such a sample may be, for example, a serum sample from a subject suspected of having levels of circulating antigen considered to be diagnostic of a pathology.    After rinsing away the test sample or standard, the wells are treated with a second fully human monoclonal PCSK9 antibody that is labeled by conjugation with biotin. A monoclonal or mouse or other species origin can also be used. The labeled PCSK9 antibody serves as a detecting antibody. After rinsing away excess second antibody, the wells are treated with avidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and a suitable chromogenic substrate. The concentration of the antigen in the test samples is determined by comparison with a standard curve developed from the standard samples.    This ELISA assay provides a highly specific and very sensitive assay for the detection of the PCSK9 antigen in a test sample.    Determination of PCSK9 Protein Concentration in Subjects    A sandwich ELISA can quantify PCSK9 levels in human serum. Two fully human monoclonal PCSK9 antibodies from the sandwich ELISA, recognize different epitopes on the PCSK9 molecule. Alternatively, monoclonal antibodies of mouse or other species origin may be used. The ELISA is performed as follows: 50 .mu.L of capture PCSK9 antibody in coating buffer (0.1 M NaHCO.sub.3, pH 9.6) at a concentration of 2 .mu.g/mL is coated on ELISA plates (Fisher). After incubation at 4.degree. C. overnight, the plates are treated with 200 .mu.L of blocking buffer (0.5% BSA, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.01% Thimerosal in PBS) for 1 hour at 25.degree. C. The plates are washed (3.times.) using 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS (washing buffer, WB). Normal or patient sera (Clinomics, Bioreclaimation) are diluted in blocking buffer containing 50% human serum. The plates are incubated with serum samples overnight at 4.degree. C., washed with WB, and then incubated with 100 .mu.L/well of biotinylated detection PCSK9 antibody for 1 hour at 25.degree. C. After washing, the plates are incubated with HRP-Streptavidin for 15 minutes, washed as before, and then treated with 100 .mu.L/well of o-phenylenediamine in H.sub.2O.sub.2 (Sigma developing solution) for color generation. The reaction is stopped with 50 .mu.L/well of H.sub.2SO.sub.4 (2M) and analyzed using an ELISA plate reader at 492 nm. Concentration of PCSK9 antigen in serum samples is calculated by comparison to dilutions of purified PCSK9 antigen using a four parameter curve fitting program.    Determination of PCSK9 Variant Protein Concentration in Subjects    The steps outlined above can be performed using antibodies noted herein that bind to both the wild type PCSK9 and the variant PCSK9 (D374Y). Next, antibodies that bind to the wild type but not the mutant can be used (again using a similar protocol as outlined above) to determine if the PCSK9 present in the subject is wild type or the D374Y variant. As will be appreciatedy by one of skill in the art, results that are positive for both rounds will be wild-type, while those that are positive for the first round, but not the second round of antibodies, will include the D374Y mutation. There are high frequency mutations in the population that are known and the could benefit particularly from an agent such as the ABPs disclosed herein.    Example 23    Use of PCSK9 Antigen Binding Protein for the Prevention of Hypercholesterolemia    A human patient exhibiting a risk of developing hypercholesterolemia is identified via family history analysis and/or lifestyle, and/or current cholesterol levels. The subject is regularly administered (e.g., one time weekly) a therapeutically effective amount of PCSK9 antibody, 31H4 (or, for example, 21B12 or 16F12). At periodic times during the treatment, the patient is monitored to determine whether serum cholesterol levels have decreased. Following treatment, it is found that subjects undergoing preventative treatment with the PCSK9 antibody have lowered serum cholesterol levels, in comparison to subjects that are not treated.    Example 24    PCSK9 ABPs Further Upregulated LDLR in the Presence of Statins    This example demonstrates that ABPs to PCSK9 produced further increases in LDLR availability when used in the presence of statins, demonstrating that further benefits can be achieved by the combined use of the two.    HepG2 cells were seeded in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and grown to .about.90% confluence. The cells were treated with indicated amounts of mevinolin (a statin, Sigma) and PCSK9 ABPs (FIGS. 12A-12C) in DMEM with 3% FBS for 48 hours. Total cell lysates were prepared. 50 mg of total proteins were separated by gel electrophoresis and transferred to PVDF membrane. Immunoblots were performed using rabbit anti-human LDL receptor antibody (Fitzgerald) or rabbit anti-human b-actin antibody. The enhanced chemiluminescent results are shown in the top panels of FIGS. 12A-12C. The intensity of the bands were quantified by ImageJ software and normalized by b-actin. The relative levels of LDLR are shown in the lower panels of FIGS. 12A-12C. ABPs 21B12 and 31H4 are PCSK9 neutralizing antibodies, while 25A7.1 is a non-neutralizing antibody.    HepG2-PCSK9 cells were also created. These were stable HepG2 cell line transfected with human PCSK9. The cells were seeded in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and grew to 90% confluence. The cells were treated with indicated amounts of mevinolin (Sigma) and PCSK9 ABPs (FIGS. 12D-12F) in DMEM with 3% FBS for 48 hours. Total cell lysates were prepared. 50 mg of total proteins were separated by gel electrophoresis and transferred to PVDF membrane. Immunoblots were performed using rabbit anti-human LDL receptor antibody (Fitzgerald) or rabbit anti-human b-actin antibody. The enhanced chemiluminescent results are shown in the top panels. The intensity of the bands were quantified by ImageJ software and normalized by b-actin.    As can be seen in the results depicted in FIGS. 12A-12F, increasing amounts of the neutralizing antibody and increasing amounts of the statin generally resulted in increases in the level of LDLR. This increase in effectiveness for increasing levels of the ABP is especially evident in FIGS. 12D-12F, in which the cells were also transfected with PCSK9, allowing the ABPs to demonstrate their effectiveness to a greater extent.    Interestingly, as demonstrated by the results in the comparison of FIGS. 12D-12F to 12A-12C, the influcence of the ABP concentrations on LDLR levels increased dramatically when PCSK9 was being produced by the cells. In addition, it is clear that the neutralizing ABPs (21B12 and 31H4) resulted in a greater increase in LDLR levels, even in the presence of statins, than the 25A7.1 ABP (a non-neutralizer), demonstrating that additional benefits can be achieved by the use of both statins and ABPs to PCSK9.    Example 25    Consensus Sequences    Consensus sequences were determined using standard phylogenic analyses of the CDRs corresponding to the V.sub.H and V.sub.L of anti-PCSK9 ABPs. The consensus sequences were determined by keeping the CDRs contiguous within the same sequence corresponding to a V.sub.H or V.sub.L. Briefly, amino acid sequences corresponding to the entire variable domains of either V.sub.H or V.sub.L were converted to FASTA formatting for ease in processing comparative alignments and inferring phylogenies. Next, framework regions of these sequences were replaced with an artificial linker sequence ('bbbbbbbbbb' placeholders, non-specific nucleic acid construct) so that examination of the CDRs alone could be performed without introducing any amino acid position weighting bias due to coincident events (e.g., such as unrelated antibodies that serendipitously share a common germline framework heritage) while still keeping CDRs contiguous within the same sequence corresponding to a V.sub.H or V.sub.L. V.sub.H or V.sub.L sequences of this format were then subjected to sequence similarity alignment interrogation using a program that employs a standard ClutalW-like algorithm (see, Thompson et al., 1994, Nucleic Acids Res. 22:4673-4680). A gap creation penalty of 8.0 was employed along with a gap extension penalty of 2.0. This program likewise generated phylograms (phylogenic tree illustrations) based on sequence similarity alignments using either UPGMA (unweighted pair group method using arithmetic averages) or Neighbor-Joining methods (see, Saitou and Nei, 1987, Molecular Biology and Evolution 4:406-425) to construct and illustrate similarity and distinction of sequence groups via branch length comparison and grouping. Both methods produced similar results but UPGMA-derived trees were ultimately used as the method employs a simpler and more conservative set of assumptions. UPGMA-derived trees were generated where similar groups of sequences were defined as having fewer than 15 substitutions per 100 residues (see, legend in tree illustrations for scale) amongst individual sequences within the group and were used to define consensus sequence collections. The results of the comparisons are depicted in FIGS. 13A-13J. In FIG. 13E, the groups were chosen so that sequences in the light chain that clade are also a dade in the heavy chain and have fewer than 15 substitutions.    As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, the results presented in FIGS. 13A-13J present a large amount of guidance as to the importance of particular amino acids (for example, those amino acids that are conserved) and which amino acid positions can likely be altered (for example, those positions that have different amino acids for different ABPs).    Example 26    Mouse Model for PCSK9 and ABP Ability to Lower LDL in vivo    To generate mice which over-expressed human PCSK9, three week old WT C57B1/6 mice were injected via tail vein administration with various concentrations of adenoassociated virus (AAV), recombinantly modified to express human PCSK9, to determine the correct titer which would provide a measurable increase of LDL-cholesterol in the mice. Using this particular virus that expressed human PCSK9, it was determined that 4.5.times.10E12 pfu of virus would result in an LDL-cholesterol level of approximately 40 mg/dL in circulating blood (normal levels of LDL in a WT mice are approximately 10 mg/dL). The human PCSK9 levels in these animals was found to be approximately 13 ug/mL. A colony of mice were generated using this injection criteria.    One week after injection, mice were assessed for LDL-cholesterol levels, and randomized into different treatment groups. Animals were then administered, via tail vein injection, a single bolus injection of either 10 mg/kg or 30 mg/kg of 16F12, 21B12, or 31H4 antigen binding proteins. IgG2 ABP was administered in a separate group of animals as a dosing control. Subgroups of animals (n=6-7) were then euthanized at 24 and 48 hours after ABP administration. There were no effects on LDL-cholesterol levels following IgG2 administration at either dose. Both 31H4 and 21B12 demonstrated significant LDL-cholesterol lowering up to and including 48 hours post-administration, as compared to IgG2 control (shown in FIGS. 14A and 14B at two different doses). 16F12 shows an intermediary LDL-cholesterol lowering response, with levels returning to baseline of approximately 40 mg/dL by the 48 hour time point. This data is consistent with in vitro binding data (Biacore and Kinexa), which shows near equivalent binding affinity between 31H4 and 21B12, and a lesser affinity of 16F12 to human PCSK9.    As can be seen in the results, total cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol were reduced by the PCSK9 ABPs in the model (both total and HDL-C are elevated above WT mice due to the overexpression of PCSK9). While cholesterol lowering in this model appears to occur over a relatively short period of time, this is believed to be due to the levels of human PCSK9 that are present, which are supraphysiologically high in this model. In addition, given that the expression is governed by AAV, there is no regulation of PCSK9 expression. In these figures, (*) denotes a P<0.05, and (**) denotes a P<0.005 as compared to LDL-cholesterol levels observed in IgG2 control injected animals at the same time point. The 13 microgram/ml level of serum human PCSK9 in the mice corresponds to an approximately 520-fold increase above the endogenous mouse PCSK9 levels (25 ng/ml), and an approximately 75-fold increase above average human serum levels (.about.175 ng/ml). Thus, the antigen binding proteins should be even more effective in humans.    As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, the above results demonstrate that appropriateness of the mouse model for testing the antigen binding protein's ability to alter serum cholesterol in a subject. One of skill in the art will also recognize that the use of mouse HDL to monitor serum cholesterol levels in a mouse, while useful for monitoring mouse serum cholesterol levels, is not indicative of the ABPs impact on human HDL in humans. For example, Cohen et al. ('Sequence variations in PCSK9, low LDL, and protection against coronary heart disease', N Engl J Med, 354:1264-1272, 2006) demonstrated the lack of any effect of the PCSK9 loss-of-function mutations on human HDL levels (the entirety of which is incorporated by reference). Thus, one of skill in the art will appreciate that the ability of the ABP to lower mouse HDL (which lack LDL) is not indicative of the ABP's ability to lower human HDL. Indeed, as shown by Cohen, this is unlikely to occur for neutralizing antibodies in humans.    Example 27    31H4 and 21B12 Bind to the ProCat Region of PCSK9    The present example describes one method for determining where various antibodies bind to PCSK9.    The ProCat (31-449 of SEQ ID NO: 3) or V domain (450-692 of SEQ ID NO: 3) of the PCSK9 protein was combined with either antibody 31H4 or 21B12. The samples were analyzed by Native PAGE for complex formation. As can be seen in FIG. 16A and FIG. 16B, gel shifts were present for the ProCat/31H4 and ProCat/21B12 samples, demonstrating that the antibodies bound to the ProCat domain.    Example 28    The LDLR EGFa Domain Binds to the Catalytic Domain of PCSK9    The present example presents the solved crystal structure of PCSK9 ProCat (31-454 of SEQ ID NO: 3) bound to the LDLR EGFa domain (293-334) at 2.9 .ANG. resolution (the conditions for which are described in the below Examples).    A representation of the structure of PCSK9 bound to EGFa is shown in FIG. 17. The crystal structure (and its depiction in FIG. 17) reveals that the EGFa domain of LDLR binds to the catalytic domain of PCSK9. In addition, the interaction of PCSK9 and EGFa appears to occur across a surface of PCSK9 that is between residues D374 and S153 in the structure depicted in FIG. 17.    Specific core PCSK9 amino acid residues of the interaction interface with the LDLR EGFa domain were defined as PCSK9 residues that are within 5 .ANG. of the EGFa domain. The core residues are as follows: S153, I154, P155, R194, D238, A239, I369, S372, D374, C375, T377, C378, F379, V380, and S381.    Boundary PCSK9 amino acid residues of the interaction interface with the LDLR EGFa domain were defined as PCSK9 residues that are 5-8 .ANG. from the EGFa domain. The boundary residues are as follows: W156, N157, L158, E159, H193, E195, H229, R237, G240, K243, D367, I368, G370, A371, S373, S376, and Q382. Residues that are underlined are nearly or completely buried within PCSK9.    As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, the results from this example demonstrate where PCSK9 and EGFa interact. Thus, antibodies that interact with or block any of these residues can be useful as antibodies that inhibit the interaction between PCSK9 and the EGFa domain of LDLR (and/or LDLR generally). In some embodiments, antibodies that, when bound to PCSK9, interact with or block any of the above residues or are within 15-8, 8, 8-5, or 5 angstroms of the above residues are contemplated to provide useful inhibition of PCSK9 binding to LDLR.    Example 29    31H4 Interacts with Amino Acid Residues from Both the Pro- and Catalytic Domains of PCSK9    The present example presents the crystal structure of full length PCSK9 (N533A mutant of SEQ ID NO: 3) bound to the Fab fragment of 31H4, determined to 2.3 .ANG. resolution (the conditions for which are described in the below Examples). This structure, depicted in FIGS. 18A and 18B, shows that 31H4 binds to PCSK9 in the region of the catalytic site and makes contacts with amino acid residues from both the prodomain and catalytic domain.    The depicted structure also allows one to identify specific core PCSK9 amino acid residues for the interaction interface of 31H4 with PCSK9. This was defined as residues that are within 5 .ANG. of the 31H4 protein. The core residues are as follows: W72, F150, A151, Q152, T214, R215, F216, H217, A220, S221, K222, S225, H226, C255, Q256, G257, K258, N317, F318, T347, L348, G349, T350, L351, E366, D367, D374, V380, S381, Q382, S383, and G384.    The structures were also used to identify boundary PCSK9 amino acid residues for the interaction interface with 31H4. These residues were PCSK9 residues that were 5-8 .ANG. from the 31H4 protein. The boundary residues are as follows: K69, D70, P71, S148, V149, D186, T187, E211, D212, G213, R218, Q219, C223, D224, G227, H229, L253, N254, G259, P288, A290, G291, G316, R319, Y325, V346, G352, T353, G365, I368, I369, S372, S373, C378, F379, T385, S386, and Q387. Amino acid residues completely buried within the PCSK9 protein are underlined.    As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, FIG. 18B depicts the interaction between the CDRs on the antigen binding protein and PCSK9. As such, the model allows one of skill in the art to identify the residues and/or CDRs that are especially important in the paratope, and which residues are less critical to the paratope. As can be seen in FIG. 18B, the heavy chain CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3 are most directly involved in the antigen binding protein's binding to the epitope, with the CDRs from the light chain being relatively far away from the epitope. As such, it is probable that larger variations in the light chain CDRs are possible, without unduly interfering with the binding of the antigen binding protein to PCSK9. In some embodiments, residues in the structures that directly interact are conserved (or alternatively conservatively replaced) while residues that are not directly interacting with one another can be altered to a greater extent. As such, one of skill in the art, given the present teachings, can predict which residues and areas of the antigen binding proteins can be varied without unduly interfering with the antigen binding protein's ability to bind to PCSK9. For example, those residues that are located closest to PCSK9 when the antigen binding protein is bound to PCSK9 are those that likely play a more important role in the binding of the antigen binding protein to PCSK9. As above, these residues can be divided into those that are within 5 angstroms of PCSK9 and those that are between 5 and 8 angstroms. Specific core 31H4 amino acid residues of the interaction interface with PCSK9 were defined as 31H4 residues that are within 5 .ANG. of the PCSK9 protein. For the heavy chain, the residues that are within 5 angstroms include the following: T28, S30, S31, Y32, S54, S55, S56, Y57, I58, S59, Y60, N74, A75, R98, Y100, F102, W103, S104, A105, Y106, Y107, D108, A109, and D111. For the light chain, those residues that are within 5 angstroms include the following: L48, S51, Y93, and S98. For the heavy chain, those residues that are 5-8 .ANG. from the PCSK9 protein include the following: G26, F27, F29, W47, S50, I51, S52, S53, K65, F68, T69, I70, S71, R72, D73, K76, N77, D99, D101, F110, and V112. For the light chain, those residues that are within 5-8 angstroms of PCSK9 include A31, G32, Y33, D34, H36, Y38, I50, G52, N55, R56, P57, S58, D94, S95, S96, L97, G99, and S100.    As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, the results from Example 29 demonstrate where antibodies to PCSK9 can interact on PCSK9 and still block PCSK9 from interacting with EGFa (and thus LDLR). Thus, antigen binding proteins that interact with any of these PCSK9 residues, or that block any of these residues (e.g., from other antigen binding proteins that bind to these residues), can be useful as antibodies that inhibit the interaction of PCSK9 and EGFa (and LDLR accordingly). Thus, in some embodiments, antigen binding proteins that interact with any of the above residues or interact with residues that are within 5 .ANG. of the above residues are contemplated to provide useful inhibition PCSK9 binding to LDLR. Similarly, antigen binding proteins that block any of the above residues (which can be determined, for example, via a competition assay) can also be useful for inhibition of the PCSK9/LDLR interaction.    Example 30    21B12 Binds to the Catalytic Domain of PCSK9, has a Distinct Binding Site from 31H4 and can Bind to PCSK9 Simultaneously with 31H4    The present example presents the crystal structure of PCSK9 ProCat (31-449 of SEQ ID NO: 3) bound to the Fab fragments of 31H4 and 21B12, determined at 2.8 .ANG. resolution (the conditions for which are described in the below Examples). This crystal structure, depicted in FIG. 19A and FIG. 19B, shows that 31H4 and 21B12 have distinct binding sites on PCSK9 and that both antigen binding proteins can bind to PCSK9 simultaneously. The structure shows that 21B12 interacts with amino acid residues from PCSK9's catalytic domain. In this structure, the interaction between PCSK9 and 31H4 is similar to what was observed above.    Specific core PCSK9 amino acid residues of the interaction interface with 21B12 were defined as PCSK9 residues that are within 5 .ANG. of the 21B12 protein. The core residues are as follows: S153, S188, I189, Q190, S191, D192, R194, E197, G198, R199, V200, D224, R237, D238, K243, S373, D374, S376, T377, and F379.    Boundary PCSK9 amino acid residues of the interaction interface with 21B12 were defined as PCSK9 residues that were 5-8 .ANG. from the 21B12 protein. The boundary residues are as follows: 1154, T187, H193, E195, I196, M201, V202, C223, T228, S235, G236, A239, G244, M247, I369, S372, C375, and C378. Amino acid residues nearly or completely buried within the PCSK9 protein are underlined.    As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, FIG. 19B depicts the interaction between the CDRs on the antigen binding protein and PCSK9. As such, the model allows one of skill in the art to identify the residues and/or CDRs which are especially important for the paratope and which residues are less critical to the paratope. As can be seen in the structure, heavy chain CDR2 and light chain CDR1 appear to closely interact with the epitope. Next, heavy chain CDR1, heavy chain CDR3 and light chain CDR3, appear to be close to the epitope, but not as close as the first set of CDRs. Finally, light chain CDR2 appears to be some distance from the epitope. As such, it is probable that larger variations in the more distant CDRs are possible without unduly interfering with the binding of the antigen binding protein to PCSK9. In some embodiments, residues in the structures that directly interact are conserved (or alternatively conservatively replaced) while residues that are not directly interacting with one another can be altered to a greater extent. As such, one of skill in the art, given the present teachings, can predict which residues and areas of the antigen binding proteins can be varied without unduly interfering with the antigen binding protein's ability to bind to PCSK9. For example, those residues that are located closest to PCSK9 when the antigen binding protein is bound to PCSK9 are those that likely play a more important role in the binding of the antigen binding protein to PCSK9. As above, these residues can be divided into those that are within 5 angstroms of PCSK9 and those that are between 5 and 8 angstroms. Specific core 21B12 amino acid residues of the interaction interface with PCSK9 were defined as 21B12 residues that are within 5 .ANG. of the PCSK9 protein. For the heavy chain, the residues that are within 5 angstroms include the following: T30, S31, Y32, G33, W50, S52, F53, Y54, N55, N57, N59, R98, G99, Y100, and G101. For the light chain, those residues that are within 5 angstroms include the following: G30, G31, Y32, N33, S34, E52, Y93, T94, S95, T96, and S97. For the heavy chain, those residues that are 5-8 .ANG. from the PCSK9 protein include the following: T28, L29, I34, S35, W47, V51, G56, T58, Y60, T72, M102, and D103. For the light chain, those residues that are within 5-8 angstroms of PCSK9 include the following: S26, V29, V35, Y51, N55, S92, M98, and V99.    As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, the results from Example 30 demonstrate where antigen binding proteins to PCSK9 can interact on PCSK9 and still block PCSK9 from interacting with EGFa (and thus LDLR). Thus, antigen binding proteins that interact with any of these PCSK9 residues or that block any of these residues can be useful as antibodies that inhibit the interaction of PCSK9 and EGFa (and LDLR accordingly). Thus, in some embodiments, antibodies that interact with any of the above residues or interact with residues that are within 5 .ANG. of the above residues are contemplated to provide useful inhibition PCSK9 binding to LDLR. Similarly, antigen binding proteins that block any of the above residues (which can be determined, for example, via a competition assay) can also be useful for inhibition of PCSK9/LDLR interaction.    Example 31    Interaction between EGFa, PCSK9, and the Antibodies    The structure of the ternary complex (PCSK9/31H4/21B12) from the above example was overlaid on the PCSK9/EGFa structure (determined as described in Example 28) and the result of this combination is depicted in FIG. 20A. This figure demonstrates areas on PCSK9 which can be usefully targeted to inhibit PCSK9 interaction with EGFa. The figure shows that both 31H4 and 21B12 partially overlap with the position of the EGFa domain of LDLR and sterically interfere with its binding to PCSK9. In addition, as can be seen in the structures, 21B12 directly interacts with a subset of amino acid residues that are specifically involved in binding to the LDLR EGFa domain.    As noted above, analysis of the crystal structures identified specific amino acids involved in the interaction between PCSK9 and the partner proteins (the core and boundary regions of the interface on the PCSK9 surface) and the spatial requirements of these partner proteins to interact with PCSK9. The structures suggest ways to inhibit the interaction between and the LDLR. First, as noted above, binding an agent to PCSK9 where it shares residues in common with the binding site of the EGFa domain of the LDLR would inhibit the interaction between PCSK9 and the LDLR. Second, an agent that binds outside of the residues in common can sterically interfere with the EGFa domain or regions of the LDLR that are either N- or C-terminal to the EGFa domain to prevent the interaction between PCSK9 and the LDLR.    In some embodiments, the residues that are involved in both EGFa binding and are close to the areas where the above noted antigen binding proteins bind are especially useful for manipulating PCSK9 binding to LDLR. For example, amino acid residues from interfaces in common in both the core region and boundary region for the different binding partners are listed in Table 12 below. Amino acid residues completely buried within the PCSK9 protein are underlined.    TABLE-US-00015 TABLE 12 Parameters Amino acid position(s) 31H4/EGFa both under 5 .ANG.

H193, E195    As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, in some embodiments, the antigen binding proteins bind to and/or block at least one of the above noted residues.    Example 32    Structural Interaction of LDLR and PCSK9    A model of full length PCSK9 bound to a full length representation of the LDLR was made using the PCSK9 ProCat (31-454 of SEQ ID NO: 3)/EGFa complex structure. The structure of full length PCSK9.sup.1 (Piper, D. E. et al. The crystal structure of PCSK9: a regulator of plasma LDL-cholesterol. Structure 15, 545-52 (2007)) was overlaid onto the PCSK9 ProCat 31-454 from the complex and the structure of the LDLR in its low pH conformation (Rudenko, G. et al. Structure of the LDL receptor extracellular domain at endosomal pH. Science 298, 2353-8 (2002)) was overlaid onto the EGFa domain from the complex. Depictions of the model are shown in FIGS. 20B and 20C. The EGFa domain is indicated by the box in the figure. The figures show regions of the LDLR outside of the immediate EGFa binding domain that lie in close proximity to PCSK9. FIGS. 20D-20F show the above interaction, along with mesh surface representations of antibody 31H4 and 21B12 from three different angles. As is clear from the depictions, not only can the antibody interact and/or interfere with LDLR's interaction with PCSK9 at the actual binding site, but other steric interactions appear to occur as well.    In light of the above results, it is clear that antigen binding proteins that bind to PCSK9 can also inhibit the interaction between PCSK9 and the LDLR by clashing with various regions of the LDLR (not just the site at which LDLR and PCSK9 interact). For example, it can clash with repeat 7 (R7), the EGFb domain, and/or the .beta.-propeller domain.    Embodiments of Antigen Binding Molecules that Bind to or Block EGFa Interaction with PCSK9    As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, Examples 28-32, and their accompanying figures, provide a detailed description of how and where EGFa interacts with PCSK9 and how two representative neutralizing antigen binding proteins, 21B12 and 31H4 interact with PCSK9 and produce their neutralizing effect. As such, one of skill in the art will readily be able to identify antigen binding molecules that can similarly reduce the binding between EGFa (including LDLR) and PCSK9 by identifying other antigen binding molecules that bind at or near at least one of the same locations on PCSK9. While the relevant locations (or epitopes) on PCSK9 are identified in the figures and the present description, it can also be advantageous to describe these sites as being within a set distance from residues that have been identified as close to the EGFa binding site. In some embodiments, an antigen binding molecule will bind to or within 30 angstroms of one or more of the following residues (numbering in reference to SEQ ID NO: 3): S153, I154, P155, R194, D238, A239, I369, S372, D374, C375, T377, C378, F379, V380, S381, W156, N157, L158, E159, H193, E195, H229, R237, G240, K243, D367, I368, G370, A371, S373, S376, Q382, W72, F150, A151, Q152, T214, R215, F216, H217, A220, S221, K222, S225, H226, C255, Q256, G257, K258, N317, F318, T347, L348, G349, T350, L351, E366, D367, D374, V380, S381, Q382, S383, G384, K69, D70, P71, S148, V149, D186, T187, E211, D212, G213, R218, Q219, C223, D224, G227, H229, L253, N254, G259, P288, A290, G291, G316, R319, Y325, V346, G352, T353, G365, I368, I369, S372, S373, C378, F379, T385, S386, Q387, S153, S188, I189, Q190, S191, D192, R194, E197, G198, R199, V200, D224, R237, D238, K243, S373, D374, S376, T377, F379, I154, T187, H193, E195, I196, M201, V202, C223, T228, S235, G236, A239, G244, M247, I369, S372, C375, or C378. In some embodiments, the antigen binding molecule binds within 30 angstroms of one or more of the following residues (numbering in reference to SEQ ID NO: 3): S153, I154, P155, R194, D238, A239, I369, S372, D374, C375, T377, C378, F379, V380, S381, W156, N157, L158, E159, H193, E195, H229, R237, G240, K243, D367, I368, G370, A371, S373, S376, or Q382. In some embodiments, the antigen binding molecule binds within 30 angstroms of one or more of the following residues (numbering in reference to SEQ ID NO: 3): W72, F150, A151, Q152, T214, R215, F216, H217, A220, S221, K222, S225, H226, C255, Q256, G257, K258, N317, F318, T347, L348, G349, T350, L351, E366, D367, D374, V380, S381, Q382, S383, G384, K69, D70, P71, S148, V149, D186, T187, E211, D212, G213, R218, Q219, C223, D224, G227, H229, L253, N254, G259, P288, A290, G291, G316, R319, Y325, V346, G352, T353, G365, I368, I369, S372, S373, C378, F379, T385, S386, or Q387. In some embodiments, the antigen binding molecule binds within 30 angstroms of one or more of the following residues (numbering in reference to SEQ ID NO: 3): S153, S188, I189, Q190, S191, D192, R194, E197, G198, R199, V200, D224, R237, D238, K243, S373, D374, S376, T377, F379, I154, T187, H193, E195, I196, M201, V202, C223, T228, S235, G236, A239, G244, M247, I369, S372, C375, or C378.    In some embodiments, the antigen binding molecule binds within 30, 30-25, 25-20, 20-15, 15-8, 8, 8-5, 5, 5-4, 4 or less angstroms from one or more of the above residues. In some embodiments, the antigen binding molecule, when bound to PCSK9, is within at least one of the above distances, for more than one of the above noted residues. For example, in some embodiments, the antigen binding molecule is within one of the recited distances (e.g., 30, 30-25, 25-20, 20-15, 15-8, 8, 8-5, 5, 5-4, 4 or less) for at least 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 20-25, 25-30, 30-35, 35-40, 40-45, 45-50, 50-55, 55-60, 60-65, 65-70, 70-75 or more of the above residues. In some embodiments, the antigen binding molecule is within one of the recited distances for at least 1-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-40, 40-50, 50-60, 60-70, 70-80, 80-90, 90-95, 95-99, 99-100% of the residues identified in each group of subgroup thereof (such as only those surface residues in the group). Unless specifically stated otherwise, the distance between the antigen binding molecule and PCSK9 is the shortest distance between the covalently bonded atom on PCSK9 and the covalently bonded atom of the antigen binding molecule that are the closest atoms of PCSK9 and the antigen binding molecule. Similarly, unless specifically stated otherwise, the distance between a residue (on the antigen binding molecule or PCSK9) and another protein (either PCSK9 or the antigen binding molecule respectively), is the distance from the closest point on the identified residue to the closest covalently bonded part of the other protein. In some embodiments, the distance can be measured from the backbone of the amino acid chains. In some embodiments, the distance can be measured between an edge of the paratope and an edge (closest to one another) of the epitope. In some embodiments, the distance can be measured between the center of the surface of the paratope and the center of the surface of the epitope. As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, the present description is applicable for each of the individual sets of residues listed herein. For example, the above ranges are contemplated generally and specifically for the 8 angstrom residues listed in Examples 28-32 and the 5 angstrom residues listed in Examples 28-32.    In some embodiments, the antigen binding molecule binds to a surface on PCSK9 that is bound by at least one of EGFa, 21B12, or 31H4. In some embodiments, the antigen binding molecule binds to PCSK9 at a location that overlaps with the interaction locations between PCSK9 and EFGa, Ab 31H4, and/or Ab 21B12 (as described in the above examples and figures). In some embodiments, the antigen binding molecule binds to PCSK9 at a position that is further away from one of the above recited residues. In some embodiments, such an antigen binding molecule can still be an effective neutralizing antigen binding molecule.    In some embodiments, the structure of the catalytic domain of PCSK9 can be described as generally being triangular (as shown in FIG. 19A). The first side of the triangle is shown as being bound by 31H4. The second side of the triangle is shown as being bound by 21B12, and the third side of the triangle is positioned toward the bottom of the page, immediately above the 'FIG. 19A' label. In some embodiments, antigen binding molecules that bind to the first and/or second sides of the catalytic domain of PCSK9 can be useful as neutralizing antibodies as they can either directly or sterically interfere with EGFa's binding to PCSK9. As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, when the antigen binding molecules are large enough, such as a full antibody, the antigen binding molecule need not directly bind to the EGFa binding site in order to interfere with the binding of EGFa to PCSK9.    As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, while the EGFa domain of the LDLR has been used in many of the examples, the models and structures are still applicable to how the full length LDLR protein will interact with PCSK9. Indeed, the additional structure present on the full length LDLR protein presents additional protein space that can further be blocked by one of the antigen binding molecules. As such, if the antigen binding molecule blocks or inhibits binding of EGFa to PCSK9, it will likely be at least as, if not more, effective with the full length LDLR protein. Similarly, antigen binding molecules that are within a set distance or block various residues that are relevant for inhibiting EGFa binding, will likely be as effective, if not more effective, for the full length LDLR.    As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, any molecule that blocks or binds to the above noted PCSK9 residues (or within the recited distances), or that inhibits one or more of the interactions noted in the above examples and figures, can be used to inhibit the interaction of EGFa (or LDLR generally) and PCSK9. As such, the molecule need not be limited to an antigen binding 'protein,' as any antigen binding molecule can also serve the required purpose. Examples of antigen binding molecules include aptamers, which can be either oligonucleic acid or peptide molecules. Other examples of antigen binding molecules include avimers, peptibodies, small molecules and polymers, and modified versions of EGFa that can increase its affinity to PCSK9 and/or half-life, such as mutation of amino acids, glycosylation, pegylation, Fc fusions, and avimer fusions. As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, in some embodiments LDLR is not an antigen binding molecule. In some embodiments, binding subsections of LDLR are not antigen binding molecules, e.g., EGFa. In some embodiments, other molecules through which PCSK9 signals in vivo are not antigen binding molecules. Such embodiments will be explicitly identified as such.    Example 33    Expression and Purification of Protein Samples    The present example describes some embodiments for how the various embodiments of the PCSK9 proteins/variants were made and purified (including the LDLR EGFa domain). PCSK9 proteins/variants (e.g., PSCK9 31-692 N533A, PCSK9 449TEV and PCSK9 ProCat 31-454) were expressed in baculovirus infected Hi-5 insect cells with an N-terminal honeybee melittin signal peptide followed by a His.sub.6 tag. The PCSK9 proteins were purified by nickel affinity chromatography, ion exchange chromatography and size exclusion chromatography. The melittin-His.sub.6 tag was removed during purification by cleavage with TEV protease. The construct PCSK9 449TEV was used to generate PCSK9 ProCat (31-449) and V domain (450-692) samples. This construct had a TEV protease cleavage site inserted between PCSK9 residues 449 and 450. For the full length N555A variant for crystallography, the PCSK9 31-454 fragment, and the PCSK9 449TEV variant for crystalography, the post rTEV protein product also included an initial GAMG sequence. Thus, post rTEV cleavage, these proteins were GAMG-PCSK9. Furthermore, the PCSK9 449TEV protein included the sequence 'ENLYFQ' (SEQ ID NO: 403) inserted between positions H449 and G450 of SEQ ID NO: 3. After cleavage with rTEV, the PCSK9 ProCat protein generated from this construct was GAMG-PCSK9 (31-449)-ENLYFQ and the V domain generated from this construct was PCSK9 (450-692) of SEQ ID NO: 3.    The 21B12 and 31H.sub.4Fab fragments were expressed in E. coli. These proteins were purified by nickel affinity chromatography, size exclusion chromatography and ion exchange chromatography.    The LDLR EGFa domain (293-334) was expressed as a GST fusion protein in E. coli. The EGFa domain was purified by ion exchange chromatography, glutathione sepharose affinity chromatography and size exclusion chromatography. The GST protein was removed during the purification by cleavage with PreScission protease.    Example 34    Complex Formation and Crystallization    The present example describes how complexes and crystals used in the above structure examination Examples were made.    The PCSK9 31-692 N533A/31H4 complex was made by mixing a 1.5 molar excess of the 311H.sub.4Fab with PCSK9. The complex was purified by size exclusion chromatography to remove excess 31H.sub.4Fab. The PCSK9 31-692 N533A/31H4 complex crystallizes in 0.1 M Tris pH 8.3, 0.2 M sodium acetate, 15% PEG 4000, 6% dextran sulfate sodium salt (Mr 5000).    The PCSK9 ProCat 31-449/31H4/21B12 complex was made by first mixing a 1.5 molar excess of 31H.sub.4Fab with PCSK9 31-449. The complex was separated from excess 31H4 by purification on a size exclusion chromatography column. A 1.5 molar excess of 21B12 Fab was then added to the PCSK9 31-449/31H4 complex. The ternary complex was separated from excess 21B12 by purification on a size exclusion chromatography column. The PCSK9 ProCat 31-449/31H4/21B12 complex crystallizes in 0.1 M Tris pH 8.5, 0.2 M ammonium phosphate monobasic, 50% MPD.    The PCSK9 ProCat 31-454/EGFa complex was made by mixing a 1.2 molar excess of EGFa domain with PCSK9 31-454. The PCSK9 ProCat 31-454/EGFa domain complex crystallizes in 0.2 M potassium formate, 20% PEG 3350.    Example 35    Data Collection and Structure Determination    The present example describes how the datasets were collected and the structures determined for the above structure examination Examples.    Initial datasets for the PCSK9 31-692 N533A/31H4 and PCSK9 ProCat 31-449/31H4/21B12 crystals were collected on a Rigaku FR-E X-ray source. The PCSK9 ProCat 31-454/EGFa dataset and higher resolution datasets for the PCSK9 31-692 N533A/31H4 and PCSK9 ProCat 31-449/31H4/21B12 crystals were collected at the Berkeley Advanced Light Source beamline 5.0.2. All datasets were processed with denzo/scalepack or HKL2000 (Otwinowski, Z., Borek, D., Majewski, W. & Minor, W. Multiparametric scaling of diffraction intensities. Acta Crystallogr A 59, 228-34 (2003)).    PCSK9/31H4 crystals grew in the C2 space group with unit cell dimensions a--264.9, b=137.4, c=69.9 .ANG., .beta.=102.8.degree. and diffract to 2.3 .ANG. resolution. The PCSK9/31H4 structure was solved by molecular replacement with the program MOLREP (The CCP4 suite: programs for protein crystallography. Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr 50, 760-3 (1994) using the PCSK9 structure (Piper, D. E. et al. The crystal structure of PCSK9: a regulator of plasma LDL-cholesterol. Structure 15, 545-52 (2007)) as the starting search model. Keeping the PCSK9 31-692 solution fixed, an antibody variable domain was used as a search model. Keeping the PCSK9 31-692/antibody variable domain solution fixed, an antibody constant domain was used as a search model. The complete structure was improved with multiple rounds of model building with Quanta and refinement with cnx. (Brunger, A. T. et al. Crystallography & NMR system: A new software suite for macromolecular structure determination. Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr 54, 905-21 (1998)).    PCSK9/31H4/21B12 crystals grew in the P2.sub.12.sub.12 space group with unit cell dimensions a=138.7, b=246.2, c=51.3 .ANG. and diffract to 2.8 .ANG. resolution. The PCSK9/31H4/21B12 structure was solved by molecular replacement with the program MOLREP using the PCSK9 ProCat/31H4 variable domain as the starting search model. Keeping the PCSK9 ProCat 31H4 variable domain fixed, a search for antibody constant domain was performed. Keeping the PCSK9 ProCat/31H4/21B12 constant domain fixed, an antibody variable domain was used as a search model. The complete structure was improved with multiple rounds of model building with Quanta and refinement with cnx.    PCSK9/EGFa domain crystals grew in the space group P6.sub.522 with unit cell dimensions a=b=70.6, c=321.8 .ANG. and diffract to 2.9 .ANG. resolution. The PCSK9/EGFa domain structure was solved by molecular replacement with the program MOLREP using the PCSK9 ProCat as the starting search model. Analysis of the electron density maps showed clear electron density for the EGFa domain. The LDLR EGFa domain was fit by hand and the model was improved with multiple rounds of model building with Quanta and refinement with cnx.    Core interaction interface amino acids were determined as being all amino acid residues with at least one atom less than or equal to 5 .ANG. from the PCSK9 partner protein. 5 .ANG. was chosen as the core region cutoff distance to allow for atoms within a van der Waals radius plus a possible water-mediated hydrogen bond. Boundary interaction interface amino acids were determined as all amino acid residues with at least one atom less than or equal to 8 .ANG. from the PCSK9 partner protein but not included in the core interaction list. Less than or equal to 8 .ANG. was chosen as the boundary region cutoff distance to allow for the length of an extended arginine amino acid. Amino acids that met these distance criteria were calculated with the program PyMOL. (DeLano, W. L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. (Palo Alto, 2002)).    Example 36    Cyrstal Structure of PCSK9 and 31A4    The crystal structure of the 31A4/PCSK9 complex was deteremined.    Expression and Purification of Protein Samples    PCSK9 449TEV (a PCSK9 construct with a TEV protease cleavage site inserted between residue 449 and 450, numbering according to SEQ ID NO: 3) was expressed in baculovirus infected Hi-5 insect cells with an N-terminal honeybee melittin signal peptide followed by a His.sub.6 tag. The PCSK9 protein was purified by first by nickel affinity chromatography. TEV protease was used to remove the melittin-His.sub.6 tag and cleave the PCSK9 protein between the catalytic domain and V domain. The V domain was further purified by ion exchange chromatography and size exclusion chromatography. The 31A4 Fab fragment was expressed in E. coli. This protein was purified by nickel affinity chromatography, size exclusion chromatography and ion exchange chromatography.    Complex Formation and Crystallization    The PCSK9 V domain/31A4 complex was made by mixing a 1.5 molar excess of PCSK9 V domain with 31A4 Fab. The complex was separated from excess PCSK9 V domain by purification on a size exclusion chromatography column. The PCSK9 V domain/31A4 complex crystallized in 1.1 M Succinic acid pH 7, 2% PEG MME 2000.    Data Collection and Structure Determination    The dataset for the PCSK9 V domain/31A4 crystal was collected on a Rigaku FR-E x-ray source and processed with denzo/scalepack (Otwinowski, Z., Borek, D., Majewski, W. & Minor, W. Multiparametric scaling of diffraction intensities. Acta Crystallogr A 59, 228-34 (2003)).    PCSK9 V domain/31A4 crystals grow in the P2.sub.12.sub.12, space group with unit cell dimensions a=74.6, b=131.1, c=197.9 .ANG. with two complex molecules per asymmetric unit, and diffract to 2.2 .ANG. resolution. The PCSK9 V domain/31A4 structure was solved by molecular replacement with the program MOLREP (CCP4. The CCP4 suite: programs for protein crystallography. Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr 50, 760-3 (1994)) using the V domain of the PCSK9 structure (Piper, D. E. et al. The crystal structure of PCSK9: a regulator of plasma LDL-cholesterol. Structure 15, 545-52 (2007)) as the starting search model. Keeping the PCSK9 450-692 solution fixed, an antibody variable domain was used as a search model. After initial refinement, the antibody constant domains were fit by hand. The complete structure was improved with multiple rounds of model building with Quanta and refinement with cnx (Brunger, A. T. et al. Crystallography & NMR system: A new software suite for macromolecular structure determination. Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr 54, 905-21 (1998)).    Core interaction interface amino acids were determined as being all amino acid residues with at least one atom less than or equal to 5 .ANG. from the PCSK9 partner protein. 5 .ANG. was chosen as the core region cutoff distance to allow for atoms within a van der Waals radius plus a possible water-mediated hydrogen bond. Boundary interaction interface amino acids were determined as all amino acid residues with at least one atom less than or equal to 8 .ANG. from the PCSK9 partner protein but not included in the core interaction list. Less than or equal to 8 .ANG. was chosen as the boundary region cutoff distance to allow for the length of an extended arginine amino acid. Amino acids that met these distance criteria were calculated with the program PyMOL (DeLano, W. L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. (Palo Alto, 2002)). Distances were calculated using the V domain 'A' and 31A4 'L1,H1' complex.    The crystal structure of the PCSK9 V domain bound to the Fab fragment of 31A4 was determined at 2.2 .ANG. resolution. The depictions of the crystal structure are provided in FIGS. 21A-21D. FIGS. 21A-21C shows that the 31A4 Fab binds to the PCSK9 V domain in the region of subdomains 1 and 2.    A model of full length PCSK9 bound the 31A4 Fab was made. The structure of full length PCSK9 was overlaid onto the PCSK9 V domain from the complex. A figure of this model is shown in FIG. 21D. The site of the interaction between the EGFa domain of the LDLR and PCSK9 is highlighted.    Analysis of the structure shows where this antibody interacts with PCSK9 and demonstrated that antibodies that do not bind to the LDLR binding surface of PCSK9 can still inhibit the degradation of LDLR that is mediated through PCSK9 (when the results are viewed in combination with Example 40 and 41 below). In addition, analysis of the crystal structure allows for identification of specific amino acids involved in the interaction between PCSK9 and the 31A4 antibody. Furthermore, the core and boundary regions of the interface on the PCSK9 surface were also determined. Specific core PCSK9 amino acid residues of the interaction interface with 31A4 were defined as PCSK9 residues that are within 5 .ANG. of the 31A4 protein. The core residues are T468, R469, M470, A471, T472, R496, R499, E501, A502, Q503, R510, H512, F515, P540, P541, A542, E543, H565, W566, E567, V568, E569, R592, and E593. Boundary PCSK9 amino acid residues of the interaction interface with 31A4 were defined as PCSK9 residues that are 5-8 .ANG. from the 31A4 protein. The boundary residues are as follows: S465, G466, P467, A473, I474, R476, G497, E498, M500, G504, K506, L507, V508, A511, N513, A514, G516, V536, T538, A539, A544, T548, D570, L571, H591, A594, S595, and H597. Amino acid residues nearly or completely buried within the PCSK9 protein are highlighted by underline. As noted herein, the numbering references the amino acid positions of SEQ ID NO: 3 (adjusted as noted herein).    Specific core 31A4 amino acid residues of the interaction interface with PCSK9 were defined as 31A4 residues that are within 5 .ANG. of the PCSK9 protein. The core residues for the 31A4 antibody are as follows: Heavy Chain: G27, S28, F29, S30, A31, Y32, Y33, E50, N52, H53, R56, D58, K76, G98, Q99, L100, and V101; Light Chain: S31, N32, T33, Y50, S51, N52, N53, Q54, W92, and D94. Boundary 31A4 amino acid residues of the interaction interface with PCSK9 were defined as 31A4 residues that are 5-8 .ANG. from the PCSK9 protein. The boundary residues for 31A4 are as follows: Heavy Chain: V2, G26, W34, N35, W47, I51, S54, T57, Y59, A96, R97, P102, F103, and D104; Light Chain: S26, S27, N28, G30, V34, N35, R55, P56, K67, V91, D93, S95, N97, G98, and W99.    The crystal structure also displayed the spatial requirements of this ABP in its interaction with PCSK9. As shown in this structure, surprisingly, antibodies that bind to PCSK9 without directly preventing PCSK9's interaction with the LDLR can still inhibit PCSK9's function.    In some embodiments, any antigen binding protein that binds to, covers, or prevents 31A4 from interacting with any of the above residues can be employed to bind to or neutralize PCSK9. In some embodiments, the ABP binds to or interacts with at least one of the following PCSK9 (SEQ ID NO: 3) residues: T468, R469, M470, A471, T472, R496, R499, E501, A502, Q503, R510, H512, F515, P540, P541, A542, E543, H565, W566, E567, V568, E569, R592, and E593. In some embodiments, the ABP is within 5 angstroms of one or more of the above residues. In some embodiments, the ABP binds to or interacts with at least one of the following PCSK9 (SEQ ID NO: 3) residues: S465, G466, P467, A473, I474, R476, G497, E498, M500, G504, K506, L507, V508, A511, N513, A514, G516, V536, T538, A539, A544, T548, D570, L571, H591, A594, S595, and H597. In some embodiments, the ABP is 5 to 8 angstroms from one or more of the above residues. In some embodiments, the ABP interacts, blocks, or is within 8 angstroms of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, I1, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, or 50 of the above residues.    The coordinates for the crystal structures discussed in the above Examples are are presented in Table 35.1 (full length PCSK9 and 31H4), Table 35.2 (PCSK9 and EGFa), Table 35.3 (PCSK9, 31H4, and 21B12), and Table 35.4 (PCSK9 and 31A4). Antigen binding proteins and molecules that interact with the relevant areas or residues of the structure of PCSK9 (including those areas or residues within 15, 15-8, 8, 8-5, 5, or fewer angstroms from where EGFa, or the antibodies, interact with PCSK9) depicted in the figures and/or their corresponding positions on the structures from the coordinates are also contemplated.    The antibodies that are described in the coordinates were raised in E. coli and thus possess some minor amino acid differences from the fully human antibodies. The first residue in the variable region was a glutamic acid instead of a glutamine for the heavy and light chains of 21B12 and for the light chain for 31H4. In addition to the differences in the sequence of variable region, there were also some differences in the constant region of the antibodies described by the coordinates (again due to the fact that the antibody was raised in E. coli). FIG. 22 highlights (via underlining shading, or bold) the differences between the constant regions of the 21B12, 31H4, and 31A4 Fabs (raised in E. coli) when compared to SEQ ID NOs: 156, and 155. For 21B12 31H4, and 31A4, the light chain constant sequence is similar to human lambda (SEQ ID NO: 156). The underlined glycine residue is an insertion between where the 21B12 and 31H4 variable sequences stop and the lambda sequence starts.    For both 21B12 and 31H4, the heavy chain constant is similar to human IgG4 (SEQ ID NO: 155). The highlighted differences in FIG. 22 are shown in Table 36.1:    TABLE-US-00016 TABLE 36.1 Crystal SEQ ID NO: 155 S C K R G E G S Q K I T N D K R P S    In regard to 31A4, while it also has the same distinctions noted above, there are three additional differences. As shown in FIG. 22, there are two additional amino acids at the start, which comes from incomplete processing of the signal peptide in E. coli expression. In addition, there is one additional substitution in the 31A4 heavy chain constant region when compared to SEQ ID NO: 155, which is the adjustment of a L (in SEQ ID NO: 155) to a H. Finally, 31A4 does have a glutamine as the initial amino acid of the Fab, rather than the adjustment to glutamic acid noted above for 21B12 and 31H4.    For all three antibodies, the end of the heavy chain (boxed in dark grey) differs as well, but the amino acids are not ordered in the structure so they do not appear in the cooridnates. As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, his-tags are not a required part of the ABP and should not be considered as part of the ABP's sequence, unless explicitly called out by reference to a specific SEQ ID NO that includes a histidine tag and a statement that the ABP sequence 'includes the Histidine tag.'    Example 37    Epitope Mapping--Binning    An alternative set of binning experiments was conducted in addition to the set in Example 10. As in Example 10, ABPs that compete with each other can be thought of as binding to the same site on the target and in common parlance are said to 'bin' together.    A modification of the Multiplexed Binning method described by Jia, et al (J. Immunological Methods, 288 (2004) 91-98) was used. Individual bead codes of streptavidin-coated Luminex beads was incubated in 100 ul 0.5 ug/ml biotinylated monovalent mouse-anti-human IgG capture antibody (BD Pharmingen, #555785) for 1 hour at room temperature in the dark, then washed 3.times. with PBSA, phosphate buffered saline (PBS) plus 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Each bead code was separately incubated with 100 ul 2 ug/ml anti-PCSK9 antibody (Coating Antibody) for 1 hour then washed 3.times. with PBSA. The beads were pooled then dispensed to a 96-well filter plate (Millipore, #MSBVN1250). 100 ul of 2 ug/ml purified PCSK9 protein was added to half the wells. Buffer was added to the other half as control. The reaction was incubated for 1 hour then washed. 100 ul of a 2 ug/ml anti-PCSK9 antibody (Detection Ab) was added to all the wells, incubated for 1 hour then washed. An irrelevant human-IgG (Jackson, #009-000-003) was run as another control. 20 ul PE-conjugated monovalent mouse-anti-human IgG (BD Pharmingen, #555787) was added to each well and incubated for 1 hour then washed. Beads were resuspended in 100 ul PBSA and a minimum of 100 events/bead code were collected on the BioPlex instrument (BioRad).    Median Fluorescent Intensity (MFI) of the antibody pair without PCSK9 was subtracted from signal of the corresponding reaction containing PCSK9. For the antibody pair to be considered bound simultaneously, and therefore in different bins, the subtracted signal had to be greater than 3 times the signal of the antibody competing with itself and the 3 times the signal of the antibody competing with the irrelevant antibody.    The data from the above is depicted in FIGS. 23A-23D. The ABPs fell into five bins. The shaded boxes indicate ABPs that can bind simultaneously to PCSK9. The nonshaded boxes indicate those ABPs that compete with each other for binding. A summary of the results is shown in Table 37.1.    TABLE-US-00017 TABLE 37.1 BIN 1 BIN 2 BIN 3 BIN 4 BIN 5 01A12.2 27B2.1 16F12.1 11G1.5 30A4.1 03B6.1 27B2.5 22E2.1 03C4.1 13B5.1 09C9.1 12H11.1 27A6.1 13H1.1 17C2.1 28B12.1 31A4.1 21B12.2 28D6.1 31B12.1 23G1.1 31G11.1 25G4.1 31H4.1 26E10.1 08A1.2 11H4.1 08A3.1 11H8.1 11F1.1 19H9.2 26H5.1 27E7.1 27H5.1 30B9.1 02B5.1 23B5.1 27B2.6 09H6.1    Bins 1 (competes with ABP 21B12) and 3 (competes with 31H4) are exclusive of each other; bin 2 competes with bins 1 and 3; and Bin 4 does not compete with bins 1 and 3. Bin 5, in this example, is presented as a 'catch all' bin to describe those ABPs that do not fit into the other bins. Thus, the above identified ABPs in each of the binds are representative of different types of epitope locations on PCSK9, some of which overlap with each other.    As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, if the reference ABP prevents the binding of the probe ABP then the antibodies are said to be in the same bin. The order in which the ABPs are employed can be important. If ABP A is employed as the reference ABP and blocks the binding of ABP B the converse is not always true: ABP B used as the reference ABP will not necessarily block ABP A. There are a number of factors in play here: the binding of an ABP can cause conformational changes in the target which prevent the binding of the second ABP, or epitopes which overlap but do not completely occlude each other may allow for the second ABP to still have enough high-affinity interactions with the target to allow binding. ABPs with a much higher affinity may have a greater ability to bump a blocking ABP out of the way. In general, if competition is observed in either order the ABPs are said to bin together, and if both ABPs can block each other then it is likely that the epitopes overlap more completely.    Example 38    Epitope Mapping--Western Blot    The present example demonstrates whether or not the epitopes for the examined ABPs were linear or conformational. Denaturing reducing and denaturing non-reducing western blots were run to determine which antibodies have a conformational epitope. Antibodies that bind to a denaturing reducing western blot have a linear epitope and are not conformational. The results are presented in FIG. 24A and FIG. 24B. For the blot, 0.5 ug/lane of purified full-length human PCSK9 was run on a 4-12% NuPAGE Bis-Tris gel and MES SDS Running Buffer. 1 ug/ml anti-PCSK9 antibodies, except 0.5 ug/ml 31G11, were used to probe the blot. 1:5000 donkey-anti-human-IR700 secondary was used and read on a LiCOR instrument. Antibody 13H1 bound to a linear epitope on the pro-domain of PCSK9. All other antibodies displayed results that were consistent with conformational epitopes. These gels split apart the pro-domain from the rest of the protein, and the pro domain ran at about 15 kDa. In addition, 3C4 and 31A4 appeared to bind to conformational epitopes which were preserved by disulfide bonds, as these antibodies bound to PCSK-9 under denaturing conditions where the disulfide bonds had been preserved (left) but reducing the samples (right) eliminated binding.    Example 39    Epitope Mapping--Arginine/Glutamic Acid Scanning    Representative ABPs from each bin (from Example 37) were selected for further epitope analysis. An arginine/glutamic acid-scanning strategy was performed for mapping ABP binding to PCSK9. By way of background, this method determines if a residue is part of the structural epitope, meaning those residues in the antigen which contact or are buried by the antibody. Arginine and glutamic acid sidechains are charged and bulky and can disrupt antibody binding even if the mutated residue is not directly involved in antibody binding.    Residue Selection    The crystal structure of PCSK9 was used to select the residues to be mutated for epitope mapping. The method used to choose residues to mutate involved both computational mechanisms and interactive structure analysis. The PCSK9 structure contained gaps of missing residues and was missing 30 amino acids in the N--(i.e., the signal sequence) and 10 amino acids in the C-termini. The internal missing residues were modeled onto the structure, but the N- and C-terminal missing residues were not. The solvent exposure ratio for each residue was calculated: the surface area of each residue in the context of the protein (SA1) was divided by the surface area of the residue in a trimer with flanking glycines (SA2) with a conserved backbone structure. Residues with solvent exposure ratio greater than 10% (R10) were selected as well as the 40 missing terminal residues. From these, prolines and glycines with positive .PHI. angles were excluded to reduce the possibility of misfolding. The number of residues to be mutated in the V domain was reduced by using a solvent exposure ratio of 37% along with visual inspection of the entire protein to bring the total number of mutations to 285. Various orientations of the surface of PCSK9 with these various classes identifies are shown in FIG. 25A-25F. In these figures, lightest gray denotes areas that were not selected or were deselected, darker gray denotes those residues selected).    Cloning and Expression    Once the residues to be altered were identified, the various residues were altered. Human PCSK9 was cloned into the pTT5 vector with a C-terminal Flag-His tag. Mutants were made from this original construct by site-directed mutagenesis using a QuikChange II kit from Stratagene. Sense and anti-sense oligonucleotides used for mutagenesis were designed using Amgen's MutaGenie software. All PCSK9 constructs were expressed in transiently-transfected 293-6E cells in 24-well plates and re-racked into three 96-well plates with a non-mutated PCSK9 control (wild-type, WT) in each plate. Expression levels and integrity of the recombinant proteins in conditioned media were checked by Western blot. Of the 285 mutants originally selected, 41 failed in cloning or expression. 244 mutants were used for epitope mapping. An alignment of the PCSK9 parent sequence and a representative PCSK9 sequence with the 244 mutated residues is shown in FIG. 26. Separate constructs were made containing a single mutation. For the purposes of the epitope sequences and the epitope based inventions involving changes in binding, the sequences are provided in reference to SEQ ID NO: 1 and/or SEQ ID NO: 303. The sequences in FIG. 26 were the sequences used for the present binding epitope studies. One of skill in the art will appreciate that the present results apply to other PCSK9 variants disclosed herein as well (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 1 and 3, as well as the other allelic variants).    Five antibodies, a representative of each bin, were chosen for fine epitope mapping. They were 21B12, 31H4, I2H.sub.11, 31A4, 3C4. All conformational epitope antibodies. Three, 21B12, 31H4, and 31A4 were also crystallized with PCSK9, as described above.    Structural and Functional Epitopes    Epitopes can be further defined as structural or functional. Functional epitopes are generally a subset of the structural epitopes and have those residues that directly contribute to the affinity of the interaction (e.g. hydrogen bonds, ionic interactions). Structural epitopes can be thought of as the patch of the target which is covered by the antibody.    The scanning mutagenesis employed was an arginine and glutamic acid scan. These two sidechains were chosen due to their large steric bulk and their charge, which allows mutations that occur in the structural epitope to have a greater effect on antibody binding. Arginine was generally employed except when the WT reside was arginine, and in these cases the residue was mutated to glutamic acid to switch the charge.    For the purpose of epitope mapping, a bead-based multiplexed assay was used to measure antibody binding to PCSK9 and PCSK9 mutants simultaneously. Antibody binding to mutants was then compared to its binding to the wild-type in the same well. The variants were split into three groups: Group 1: 81 variants+2 wt controls+1 negative control+1 other PCSK9 supernatant; Group 2: 81 variants+2 wt controls+2 negative controls; and Group 3: 82 variants+2 wt control+1 negative control.    The assay was run as follows: 85 sets of color-coded strepavidin-coated LumAvidin beads (Luminex) were bound with biotinylated anti-pentaHis antibody (Qiagen, #1019225) for 1 hour at room temperature (RT) then washed three times in PBS, 1% BSA, 0.1% Tween 20. Each color-coded bead set was then allowed to bind to a PCSK9 mutant, wild-type, or negative control in 150 ul supernatant overnight at 4.degree. C.    The color-coded bead sets, each associated to a specific protein, were washed and pooled. At this point, there were 3 pools of 85 bead sets, one pool for each group of mutants and controls. The beads from each pool were aliquoted to 24 wells (3 columns) of a 96-well filter plate (Millipore, #MSBVN1250). 100 ul of anti-PCSK9 antibodies in 4-fold dilutions were added to nine columns for triplicate points and incubated for 1 hour at RT and washed. 100 ul of 1:200 dilution phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-human IgG Fc (Jackson Immunoresearch, #109-116-170) was added to each well and incubated for 1 hour at RT and washed.    Beads were resuspended in 1% BSA in PBS, shaken for 10 mins and read on the BioPlex instrument (Bio-Rad). The instrument identifies each bead by its color-code thereby identifying the specific protein associated with the color code. At the same time, it measures the amount of antibody bound to the beads by fluorescence intensity of the PE dye. Antibody binding to each mutant can then be compared directly its binding to the wild type in the same pool. IL-17R chimera E was used as a negative control. A summary of all of the mutants examined is shown in Table 39.1 (with reference to the sequence numbering used in FIGS. 1A and 26).

In the validation experiment, all beads were conjugated with the same wild type control protein. Therefore, the difference between beads regions was due to purely B-B variance and was not confounded by difference between wild type and mutant proteins. The titration of antibody was run with twelve replications in different wells.    The objective of this statistical analysis was to estimate the B-B variability of the estimated EC50 of binding curves. The estimated B-B standard deviation (SD) was then used to build the EC50 confidence intervals of wild type and mutant proteins during curve comparison experiments.    A four-parameter logistic model was fitted to the binding data for each bead region. The resulting file, containing curve quality control (QC) results and parameter estimates for top (max), bottom (min), Hillslope (slope), and natural log of EC50 (xmid) of the curves, was used as the raw data for the analysis. B-B variability for each parameter was then estimated by fitting mixed effect model using SAS PROC MIXED procedure. Only curves with 'good' QC status were included in the analysis. The final mixed effect model included only residual (i.e. individual bead regions) as random effect. Least squares means (LS-mean) for each parameter were estimated by the mixed effect model as well. B-B SD was calculated by taking square root of B-B variance. Fold change between LS-mean +2SD and LS-mean -2SD, which represent approximately upper and lower 97.5 percentile of the population, was also calculated. The results are displayed in Table 39.2    TABLE-US-00019 TABLE 39.2 Least square mean and bead-to-bead variance estimations B-B Assay ID parname Ls Mean Variance -2SD +2SD Fold Change* PCSK9 max 15000 997719 13002.3 16997.7 1.3 PCSK9 min 162.09 1919.66 74.5 249.7 3.4 PCSK9 slope 0.8549 0.000599 0.8 0.9 1.1 PCSK9 xmid 3.1715 0.002098 3.1 3.3 1.2 *xmid is natural log of the EC50. Fold change for xmid was converted back to original scale.    Identifying Residues in the Structural Epitope    A residue was considered part of the structural epitope (a 'hit') when mutating it to arginine or glutamic acid alters antibody binding. This is seen as a shift in the EC50 or a reduction of maximum signal compared to antibody binding to wild type. Statistical analyses of antibody binding curves to wild type and mutants were used to identify statistically significant EC50 shifts. The analysis takes into consideration variation in the assay and curve fitting.    Hit Identification Based on EC50 Comparison    The EC50 and Bmax values were generated from a Weighted 4-Parameter Logistical model fitted to the binding data using S-PLUS with VarPower software (Insightful Corporation, Seattle Wash.). The EC50s of the mutant binding curves and wild type binding curves were compared. Statistically significant differences were identified as hits for further consideration. The curves with 'nofit' or 'badfit' flags were excluded from the analysis.    The Variations in EC50 Estimates    Two sources of variations were considered in the comparison of EC50 estimates, variation from the curve fit and the bead-bead variation. Wild types and mutants were linked to different beads, hence their difference are confounded with the bead-bead difference (described above). The curve fit variation was estimated by the standard error of the log EC50 estimates. Bead-bead variation was experimentally determined using an experiment where wild type controls were linked to each one of the beads (described above). The bead variation in EC50 estimates of wild type binding curve from this experiment was used to estimate the bead-bead variation in the actual epitope mapping experiment.    Testing for EC50 Shift between Mutants and Wild Type    The comparisons of two EC50s (in log scale) was conducted using Student's t-test. The t-statistic was calculated as the ratio between delta (the absolute differences between EC50 estimates) and the standard deviation of delta. The variance of delta was estimated by the sum of the three components, variance estimate of EC50 for mutant and wild type curves in the nonlinear regression and two times the bead-bead variance estimated from a separate experiment. The multiple of two for the bead-bead variance was due to the assumption that both mutant and wild type beads had the same variance. The degree of freedom of the standard deviation of delta was calculated using the Satterthwaite's (1946) approximation. Individual p-values and confidence intervals (95% and 99%) were derived based on Student's t distribution for each comparison. In the case of multiple wild type controls, a conservative approach was taken by picking the wild type control that was most similar to the mutant, i.e., picking the ones with the largest p-values.    Multiplicity adjustments were important to control the false positive(s) while conducting a large number of tests simultaneously. Two forms of multiplicity adjustment were implemented for this analysis: family wise error (FWE) control and false discovery rate (FDR) control. The FWE approach controls the probability that one or more hits are not real; FDR approach controls the expected proportion of false positive among the selected hits. The former approach is more conservative and less powerful than the latter one. There are many methods available for both approaches, for this analysis, the Hochberg's (1988) method for FWE analysis and Benjamini-Hochberg's (1995) FDR method for FDR analysis were selected. Adjusted p-values for both approaches were calculated.    Results    EC50 Shift    Mutations whose EC50 is significantly different from wild type, e.g., having a False Discovery Rate adjusted p-value for the whole assay of 0.01 or less, were considered part of the structural epitope. All the hits also had a Familywise type I error rate adjusted p-value for each antibody of less than 0.01 except residue R185E for antibody 31H4 which had an FWE adjusted p-value per antibody of 0.0109. The residues in the structural epitope of the various antibodies determined by EC50 shift are shown in Table 39.3 (point mutations are with reference to SEQ ID NO: 1 and 303)    TABLE-US-00020 TABLE 39.3 FDR.Adjusted.

Mutations that reduced the antibody binding maximum signal by .gtoreq.70% as compared to wild type signal or that reduced the signal of one antibody compared to other antibodies by >50% when all other antibodies are at least 40% of wild type were considered hits and part of the epitope.

Table 39.5 displays a summary of all of the hits for the various antibodies.    TABLE-US-00022 TABLE 39.5 ##STR00001## *decreases EC50    To further examine how these residues form part of or all of the relevant epitopes, the above noted positions were mapped onto various crystal structure models, the results are shown in FIG. 27A through 27E. FIG. 27A depicts the 21B12 epitope hits, as mapped onto a crystal structure of PCSK9 with the 21B12 antibody. The structure identifies PCSK9 residues as follows: light gray indicates those residues that were not mutated (with the exception of those residues that are explicitly indicated on the structure) and darker gray indicates those residues mutated (a minority of which failed to express). Residues that are explicitly indicated were tested (regardless of the shading indicated on the figure) and resulted in a significant change in EC50 and/or Bmax The epitope hits were based on Bmax shift. In this figure, 31H4 is behind 21B12.    FIG. 27B depicts the 31H4 epitope hits, as mapped onto a crystal structure of PCSK9 with 31H4 and 21B12 antibodies. The structure identifies PCSK9 residues as follows: light gray indicates those residues that were not mutated (with the exception of those residues that are explicitly indicated on the structure) and darker gray indicates those residues mutated (a minority of which failed to express). Residues that are explicitly indicated were tested (regardless of the shading indicated on the figure) and resulted in a significant change in EC50 and/or Bmax. The epitope hits were based on the EC50 shift.    FIG. 27C depicts the 31A4 epitope hits, as mapped onto a crystal structure of PCSK9 with 31H4 and 21B12 antibodies. The structure identifies PCSK9 residues as follows: light gray indicates those residues that were not mutated (with the exception of those residues that are explicitly indicated on the structure) and darker gray indicates those residues mutated (a minority of which failed to express). Residues that are explicitly indicated were tested (regardless of the shading indicated on the figure) and resulted in a significant change in EC50 and/or Bmax. The epitope hits were based on the EC50 shift. 31A4 antibody is known to bind to the V-domain of PCSK9, which appears consistent with the results presented in FIG. 27C.    FIG. 27D depicts the 12H11 epitope hits, as mapped onto the crystal structure of PCSK9 with 31H4 and 21B12 antibodies. The structure identifies PCSK9 residues as follows: light gray indicates those residues that were not mutated (with the exception of those residues that are explicitly indicated on the structure) and darker gray indicates those residues mutated (a minority of which failed to express). Residues that are explicitly indicated were tested (regardless of the shading indicated on the figure) and resulted in a significant change in EC50 and/or Bmax. 12H11 competes with 21B12 and 31H4 in the binning assay described above.    FIG. 27E depicts the 3C4 epitope hits, as mapped onto the crystal structure of PCSK9 with 31H4 and 21B12 antibodies. The structure identifies PCSK9 residues as follows: light gray indicates those residues that were not mutated (with the exception of those residues that are explicitly indicated on the structure) and darker gray indicates those residues mutated (a minority of which failed to express). Residues that are explicitly indicated were tested (regardless of the shading indicated on the figure) and resulted in a significant change in EC50 and/or Bmax.    3C4 does not compete with 21B12 and 31H4 in the binning assay. 3C4 binds to the V-domain in the domain binding assay (see results from Example 40, FIGS. 28A and 28B).    While there were approximately a dozen mutants that could have been expected to have an effect on binding (based upon the crystal structure), the present experiment demonstrated that, surprisingly, they did not. As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, the results presented above are in good agreement with the crystal structures and PCSK-9's binding of these antibodies. This demonstrates that the provided structural and corresponding functional data adequately identifies the key residues and areas of interaction of the neutralizing ABPs and PCSK9. Thus, variants of the ABPs that possess the ability to bind to the above noted areas are adequately provided by the present description.    As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, while the B-max drop and EC50 shift hits can be considered manifestations of the same phenomenon, strictly speaking, a B-max drop alone does not reflect a loss of affinity per se but, rather, the destruction of some percentage of the epitope of an antibody. Although there is no overlap in the hits determined by B-max and EC50, mutations with a strong affect on binding may not allow for the generation of a useful binding curve and hence, no EC50 can be determined for such variants.    As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, ABPs in the same bin (with the exception of bin 5, which as noted above, is a general catch all bin) likely bind to overlapping sites on the target protein. As such, the above epitopes and relevant residues can generally be extended to all such ABPs in the same bin.    To further examine the above results in regard to ABP 31H4, position E181R, which, according to the above crystal structure, was predicted to interact with R185 to form part of the surface that interacts with the ABP, was also altered (E181R). The results, while not statistically significant on their own, were, when combined with the crystal structure, demonstrative of 31H4 interacting with E181R (data not shown). Thus, position 181 also appears to form part of the epitope for the 31H4 ABP.    As noted above, the above binding data and epitope characterization references a PCSK9 sequence (SEQ ID NO: 1) that does not include the first 30 amino acids of PCSK9. Thus, the numbering system of this protein fragment, and the SEQ ID NO:s that refer to this fragment, are shifted by 30 amino acids compared to the data and experiments that used a full length PCSK9 numbering system (such as that used in the crystal study data described above). Thus, to compare these results, an extra 30 amino acids should be added to the positions in each of the above epitope mapping results. For example, position 207 of SEQ ID NO: 1 (or SEQ ID NO: 303), correlates to position 237 of SEQ ID NO: 3 (the full length sequence, and the numbering system used throughout the rest of the specification). Table 39.6 outlines how the above noted positions, which reference SEQ ID NO: 1 (and/or SEQ ID NO: 303) correlate with SEQ ID NO: 3 (which includes the signal sequence).

Example 40    PCSK9 Domain Binding Assay    The present example examined where on PCSK9 the various ABPs bound.    Clear, 96 well maxisorp plates (Nunc) were coated overnight with 2 ug/ml of various anti-PCSK9 antibodies diluted in PBS. Plates were washed thoroughly with PBS/0.05% Tween-20 and then blocked for two hours with 3% BSA/PBS. After washing, plates were incubated for two hours with either full length PCSK9 (aa 31-692 SEQ ID NO: 3, procat PCSK9 (aa 31-449 SEQ ID NO: 3) or v-domain PCSK9 (aa 450-692 of SEQ ID NO: 3) diluted in general assay diluent (Immunochemistry Technologies, LLC). Plates were washed and a rabbit polyclonal biotinylated anti-PCSK9 antibody (D8774), which recognizes the procat and v-domain as well as full-length PCSK9, was added at 1 ug/ml (in 1% BSA/PBS). Bound full-length, procat or v-domain PCSK9 was detected by incubation with neutravidin-HRP (Thermo Scientific) at 200 ng/ml (in 1% BSA/PBS) followed by TMB substrate (KPL) and absorbance measurement at 650 nm. The results, presented in FIGS. 28A and 28B, demonstrate the ability of the various ABS to bind to various parts of PCSK9. As shown in FIG. 28B, ABP 31A4 binds to the V domain of PCSK9.    Example 41    Neutralizing, Non-competitive Antigen Binding Proteins    The present example demonstrates how to identify and characterize an antigen binding protein that is non-competitive with LDLR for binding with PCSK9, but is still neutralizing towards PCSK9 activity. In other words, such an antigen binding protein will not block PCSK9 from binding to LDLR, but will prevent or reduce PCSK9 mediated LDLR degradation.    Clear, 384 well plates (Costar) were coated with 2 ug/ml of goat anti-LDL receptor antibody (R&D Systems) diluted in buffer A (100 mM sodium cacodylate, pH 7.4). Plates were washed thoroughly with buffer A and then blocked for 2 hours with buffer B (1% milk in buffer A). After washing, plates were incubated for 1.5 hours with 0.4 ug/ml of LDL receptor (R&D Systems) diluted in buffer C (buffer B supplemented with 10 mM CaCl.sub.2). Concurrent with this incubation, 20 ng/ml of biotinylated D374Y PCSK9 was incubated with 100 ng/ml of antibody diluted in buffer A or buffer A alone (control). The LDL receptor containing plates were washed and the biotinylated D374Y PCSK9/antibody mixture was transferred to them and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. Binding of the biotinylated D374Y to the LDL receptor was detected by incubation with streptavidin-HRP (Biosource) at 500 ng/ml in buffer C followed by TMB substrate (KPL). The signal was quenched with 1N HCl and the absorbance read at 450 nm. The results are presented in FIG. 28C, which shows that while ABP 31H4 inhibits LDLR binding, ABP 31A4 does not inhibit LDLR binding to PCSK9. In combination with the results from Example 40 and shown in FIGS. 28A and 28B, it is clear that 31A4 ABP binds to the V domain of PCSK9 and does not block the interaction of PCSK9 with LDLR.    Next, the Ability of ABP 31A4 to serve as a neutralizing ABP was further confirmed via a cell LDL uptake assay (as described in the examples above). The results of this LDL uptake assay are presented in FIG. 28D. As shown in FIG. 28D, ABP 31A4 displays significant PCSK9 neutralizing ability. Thus, in light of Example 40 and the present results, it is clear that ABPs can bind to PCSK9 without blocking the PCSK9 and LDLR binding interaction, while still being useful as neutralizing PCSK9 ABPs.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION                [0003] The present invention relates to anti-PCSK9 antibodies and methods of using the same.                BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION                [0004] Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a member of the mammalian subtilisin family of proprotein convertases. PCSK9 plays a critical role in cholesterol metabolism by controlling the levels of low density lipoprotein (LDL) particles that circulate in the bloodstream. Elevated levels of PCSK9 have been shown to reduce LDL-receptor levels in the liver, resulting in high levels of LDL-cholesterol in the plasma and increased susceptibility to coronary artery disease. (Peterson et al., J Lipid Res. 49(7):1595-9 (2008)). Therefore, it would be highly advantageous to produce a therapeutic-based antagonist of PCSK9 that inhibits or antagonizes the activity of PCSK9 and the corresponding role PCSK9 plays in various therapeutic conditions.                SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION                [0005] The invention is in part based on a variety of antibodies to PCSK9.

DEFINITIONS                [0090] Unless defined otherwise, technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. Singleton et al., Dictionary of Microbiology and Molecular Biology 2nd ed., J. Wiley & Sons (New York, N.Y. 1994), and March, Advanced Organic Chemistry Reactions, Mechanisms and Structure 4th ed., John Wiley & Sons (New York, N.Y. 1992), provide one skilled in the art with a general guide to many of the terms used in the present application. All references cited herein, including patent applications and publications, are incorporated by reference in their entirety.                [0091] For purposes of interpreting this specification, the following definitions will apply and whenever appropriate, terms used in the singular will also include the plural and vice versa. It is to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only, and is not intended to be limiting. In the event that any definition set forth below conflicts with any document incorporated herein by reference, the definition set forth below shall control.                [0092] Throughout the present specification and claims, the numbering of the residues in an immunoglobulin heavy chain is that of the EU index as in Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1991), expressly incorporated herein by reference. The \"EU index as in Kabat\" refers to the residue numbering of the human IgG.sub.1 EU antibody.                [0093] An \"acceptor human framework\" for the purposes herein is a framework comprising the amino acid sequence of a light chain variable domain (VL) framework or a heavy chain variable domain (VH) framework derived from a human immunoglobulin framework or a human consensus framework, as defined below. An acceptor human framework \"derived from\" a human immunoglobulin framework or a human consensus framework may comprise the same amino acid sequence thereof, or it may contain amino acid sequence changes. In some embodiments, the number of amino acid changes are 10 or less, 9 or less, 8 or less, 7 or less, 6 or less, 5 or less, 4 or less, 3 or less, or 2 or less. In some embodiments, the VL acceptor human framework is identical in sequence to the VL human immunoglobulin framework sequence or human consensus framework sequence.                [0094] \"Affinity\" refers to the strength of the sum total of noncovalent interactions between a single binding site of a molecule (e.g., an antibody) and its binding partner (e.g., an antigen). Unless indicated otherwise, as used herein, \"binding affinity\" refers to intrinsic binding affinity which reflects a 1:1 interaction between members of a binding pair (e.g., antibody and antigen). The affinity of a molecule X for its partner Y can generally be represented by the dissociation constant (Kd). Affinity can be measured by common methods known in the art, including those described herein. Specific illustrative and exemplary embodiments for measuring binding affinity are described in the following.                [0095] An \"affinity matured\" antibody refers to an antibody with one or more alterations in one or more hypervariable regions (HVRs), compared to a parent antibody which does not possess such alterations, such alterations resulting in an improvement in the affinity of the antibody for antigen.                [0096] The terms \"anti-PCSK9 antibody\", \"anti-PCSK9\", \"PCSK9 antibody\" or \"an antibody that binds to PCSK9\" refers to an antibody that is capable of binding PCSK9 with sufficient affinity such that the antibody is useful as a diagnostic and/or therapeutic agent in targeting PCSK9. In one embodiment, the extent of binding of an anti-PCSK9 antibody to an unrelated, non-PCSK9 protein is less than about 10% of the binding of the antibody to PCSK9 as measured, e.g., by a radioimmunoassay (RIA). In certain embodiments, an antibody that binds to PCSK9 has a dissociation constant (Kd) of .ltoreq.1 .mu.M, .ltoreq.100 nM, .ltoreq.10 nM, .ltoreq.1 nM, .ltoreq.0.1 nM, .ltoreq.0.01 nM, or .ltoreq.0.001 nM (e.g. 10.sup.-8M or less, e.g. from 10.sup.-8M to 10.sup.-13M, e.g., from 10.sup.-9M to 10.sup.-13 M). In certain embodiments, an anti-PCSK9 antibody binds to an epitope of PCSK9 that is conserved among PCSK9 from different species.                [0097] The term \"antibody\" herein is used in the broadest sense and encompasses various antibody structures, including but not limited to monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, multispecific antibodies (e.g., bispecific antibodies), and antibody fragments so long as they exhibit the desired antigen-binding activity.                [0098] An \"antibody fragment\" refers to a molecule other than an intact antibody that comprises a portion of an intact antibody that binds the antigen to which the intact antibody binds. Examples of antibody fragments include but are not limited to Fv, Fab, Fab', Fab'-SH, F(ab').sub.2; diabodies; linear antibodies; single-chain antibody molecules (e.g. scFv); and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments. Papain digestion of antibodies produces two identical antigen-binding fragments, called \"Fab\" fragments, each with a single antigen-binding site, and a residual \"Fc\" fragment, whose name reflects its ability to crystallize readily. Pepsin treatment yields an F(ab').sub.2 fragment that has two antigen-combining sites and is still capable of cross-linking antigen.                [0099] An \"antibody that binds to the same epitope\" as a reference antibody refers to an antibody that blocks binding of the reference antibody to its antigen in a competition assay by 50% or more, and conversely, the reference antibody blocks binding of the antibody to its antigen in a competition assay by 50% or more. An exemplary competition assay is provided herein. In certain embodiments, the epitope is determined based on the crystal structure of the anti-PCSK9 antibody Fab fragment bound to PCSK9.                [0100] The term \"chimeric\" antibody refers to an antibody in which a portion of the heavy and/or light chain is derived from a particular source or species, while the remainder of the heavy and/or light chain is derived from a different source or species.                [0101] The \"class\" of an antibody refers to the type of constant domain or constant region possessed by its heavy chain. There are five major classes of antibodies: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, and several of these may be further divided into subclasses (isotypes), e.g., IgG.sub.1, IgG.sub.2, IgG.sub.3, IgG.sub.4, IgA.sub.1, and IgA.sub.2. The heavy chain constant domains that correspond to the different classes of immunoglobulins are called .alpha., .delta., .epsilon., .gamma., and .mu., respectively. The term \"cytotoxic agent\" as used herein refers to a substance that inhibits or prevents a cellular function and/or causes cell death or destruction. Cytotoxic agents include, but are not limited to, radioactive isotopes (e.g., At.sup.211, I.sup.131, I.sup.125, Y.sup.90, Re.sup.186, Re.sup.188, Sm.sup.153, Bi.sup.212, P.sup.32, Pb.sup.212 and radioactive isotopes of Lu); chemotherapeutic agents or drugs (e.g., methotrexate, adriamicin, vinca alkaloids (vincristine, vinblastine, etoposide), doxorubicin, melphalan, mitomycin C, chlorambucil, daunorubicin or other intercalating agents); growth inhibitory agents; enzymes and fragments thereof such as nucleolytic enzymes; antibiotics; toxins such as small molecule toxins or enzymatically active toxins of bacterial, fungal, plant or animal origin, including fragments and/or variants thereof; and the various antitumor or anticancer agents disclosed below.                [0102] The term \"diabodies\" refers to antibody fragments with two antigen-binding sites, which fragments comprise a heavy-chain variable domain (VH) connected to a light-chain variable domain (VL) in the same polypeptide chain (V.sub.H-V.sub.L). By using a linker that is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain, the domains are forced to pair with the complementary domains of another chain and create two antigen-binding sites. Diabodies may be bivalent or bispecific. Diabodies are described more fully in, for example, EP 404,097; WO 1993/01161; Hudson et al., Nat. Med. 9:129-134 (2003); and Hollinger et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90: 6444-6448 (1993). Triabodies and tetrabodies are also described in Hudson et al., Nat. Med. 9:129-134 (2003).                [0103] \"Effector functions\" refer to those biological activities attributable to the Fc region of an antibody, which vary with the antibody isotype. Examples of antibody effector functions include: Clq binding and complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC); Fc receptor binding; antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC); phagocytosis; down regulation of cell surface receptors (e.g. B cell receptor); and B cell activation.                [0104] An \"effective amount\" of an agent, e.g., a pharmaceutical formulation, refers to an amount effective, at dosages and for periods of time necessary, to achieve the desired therapeutic or prophylactic result.                [0105] The \"Fab\" fragment contains the heavy- and light-chain variable domains and also contains the constant domain of the light chain and the first constant domain (CH1) of the heavy chain. Fab' fragments differ from Fab fragments by the addition of a few residues at the carboxy terminus of the heavy chain CH1 domain including one or more cysteines from the antibody hinge region. Fab'-SH is the designation herein for Fab' in which the cysteine residue(s) of the constant domains bear a free thiol group. F(ab').sub.2 antibody fragments originally were produced as pairs of Fab' fragments which have hinge cysteines between them. Other chemical couplings of antibody fragments are also known.                [0106] The term \"Fc region\" herein is used to define a C-terminal region of an immunoglobulin heavy chain that contains at least a portion of the constant region. The term includes native sequence Fc regions and variant Fc regions. In certain embodiments, a human IgG heavy chain Fc region extends from Cys226, or from Pro230, to the carboxyl-terminus of the heavy chain. However, the C-terminal lysine (Lys447) of the Fc region may or may not be present. Unless otherwise specified herein, numbering of amino acid residues in the Fc region or constant region is according to the EU numbering system, also called the EU index, as described in Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md., 1991.                [0107] \"Framework\" or \"FR\" refers to variable domain residues other than hypervariable region (HVR) residues. The FR of a variable domain generally consists of four FR domains: FR1, FR2, FR3, and FR4. Accordingly, the HVRand FR sequences generally appear in the following sequence in VH (or VL): FR1-H1(L1)-FR2-H2(L2)-FR3-H3 (L3)-FR4.                [0108] The terms \"full length antibody,\" \"intact antibody,\" and \"whole antibody\" are used herein interchangeably to refer to an antibody having a structure substantially similar to a native antibody structure or having heavy chains that contain an Fc region as defined herein.                [0109] \"Fv\" is the minimum antibody fragment which contains a complete antigen-binding site. In one embodiment, a two-chain Fv species consists of a dimer of one heavy- and one light-chain variable domain in tight, non-covalent association. In a single-chain Fv (scFv) species, one heavy- and one light-chain variable domain can be covalently linked by a flexible peptide linker such that the light and heavy chains can associate in a \"dimeric\" structure analogous to that in a two-chain Fv species. It is in this configuration that the three HVRs of each variable domain interact to define an antigen-binding site on the surface of the VH-VL dimer. Collectively, the six HVRs confer antigen-binding specificity to the antibody. However, even a single variable domain (or half of an Fv comprising only three HVRs specific for an antigen) has the ability to recognize and bind antigen, although at a lower affinity than the entire binding site.                [0110] The terms \"host cell,\" \"host cell line,\" and \"host cell culture\" are used interchangeably and refer to cells into which exogenous nucleic acid has been introduced, including the progeny of such cells. Host cells include \"transformants\" and \"transformed cells,\" which include the primary transformed cell and progeny derived therefrom without regard to the number of passages. Progeny may not be completely identical in nucleic acid content to a parent cell, but may contain mutations. Mutant progeny that have the same function or biological activity as screened or selected for in the originally transformed cell are included herein.                [0111] A \"human antibody\" is one which possesses an amino acid sequence which corresponds to that of an antibody produced by a human or a human cell or derived from a non-human source that utilizes human antibody repertoires or other human antibody-encoding sequences. This definition of a human antibody specifically excludes a humanized antibody comprising non-human antigen-binding residues.                [0112] A \"human consensus framework\" is a framework which represents the most commonly occurring amino acid residues in a selection of human immunoglobulin VL or VH framework sequences. Generally, the selection of human immunoglobulin VL or VH sequences is from a subgroup of variable domain sequences. Generally, the subgroup of sequences is a subgroup as in Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, Fifth Edition, NIH Publication 91-3242, Bethesda Md. (1991), vols. 1-3. In one embodiment, for the VL, the subgroup is subgroup kappa I as in Kabat et al., supra. In one embodiment, for the VH, the subgroup is subgroup III as in Kabat et al., supra.                [0113] A \"humanized\" antibody refers to a chimeric antibody comprising amino acid residues from non-human HVRs and amino acid residues from human FRs. In certain embodiments, a humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the HVRs (e.g., CDRs) correspond to those of a non-human antibody, and all or substantially all of the FRs correspond to those of a human antibody. A humanized antibody optionally may comprise at least a portion of an antibody constant region derived from a human antibody. A \"humanized form\" of an antibody, e.g., a non-human antibody, refers to an antibody that has undergone humanization.                [0114] The term \"hypercholesterolemia,\" as used herein, refers to a condition in which cholesterol levels are elevated above a desired level. In certain embodiments, the LDL-cholesterol level is elevated above the desired level. In certain embodiments, the serum LDL-cholesterol levels are elevated above the desired level.                [0115] The term \"hypervariable region\" or \"HVR,\" as used herein, refers to each of the regions of an antibody variable domain which are hypervariable in sequence and/or form structurally defined loops (\"hypervariable loops\"). Generally, native four-chain antibodies comprise six HVRs; three in the VH(H1, H2, H3), and three in the VL (L1, L2, L3). HVRs generally comprise amino acid residues from the hypervariable loops and/or from the \"complementarity determining regions\" (CDRs), the latter being of highest sequence variability and/or involved in antigen recognition. Exemplary hypervariable loops occur at amino acid residues 26-32 (L1), 50-52 (L2), 91-96 (L3), 26-32 (H1), 53-55 (H2), and 96-101 (H3). (Chothia and Lesk, J. Mol. Biol. 196:901-917 (1987).) Exemplary CDRs (CDR-L1, CDR-L2, CDR-L3, CDR-H1, CDR-H2, and CDR-H3) occur at amino acid residues 24-34 of L1, 50-56 of L2, 89-97 of L3, 31-35B of H1, 50-65 of H2, and 95-102 of H3. (Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1991).) With the exception of CDR1 in VH, CDRs generally comprise the amino acid residues that form the hypervariable loops. CDRs also comprise \"specificity determining residues,\" or \"SDRs,\" which are residues that contact antigen. SDRs are contained within regions of the CDRs called abbreviated-CDRs, or a-CDRs. Exemplary a-CDRs (a-CDR-L1, a-CDR-L2, a-CDR-L3, a-CDR-H1, a-CDR-H2, and a-CDR-H3) occur at amino acid residues 31-34 of L1, 50-55 of L2, 89-96 of L3, 31-35B of H1, 50-58 of H2, and 95-102 of H3. (See Almagro and Fransson, Front. Biosci. 13:1619-1633 (2008).) Unless otherwise indicated, HVR residues and other residues in the variable domain (e.g., FR residues) are numbered herein according to Kabat et al., supra.                [0116] An \"immunoconjugate\" is an antibody conjugated to one or more heterologous molecule(s), including but not limited to a cytotoxic agent.                [0117] An \"individual\" or \"subject\" is a mammal. Mammals include, but are not limited to, domesticated animals (e.g., cows, sheep, cats, dogs, and horses), primates (e.g., humans and non-human primates such as monkeys), rabbits, and rodents (e.g., mice and rats). In certain embodiments, the individual or subject is a human.                [0118] An \"isolated\" antibody is one which has been separated from a component of its natural environment. In some embodiments, an antibody is purified to greater than 95% or 99% purity as determined by, for example, electrophoretic (e.g., SDS-PAGE, isoelectric focusing (IEF), capillary electrophoresis) or chromatographic (e.g., ion exchange or reverse phase HPLC). For review of methods for assessment of antibody purity, see, e.g., Flatman et al., J. Chromatogr. B 848:79-87 (2007).                [0119] An \"isolated\" nucleic acid refers to a nucleic acid molecule that has been separated from a component of its natural environment. An isolated nucleic acid includes a nucleic acid molecule contained in cells that ordinarily contain the nucleic acid molecule, but the nucleic acid molecule is present extrachromosomally or at a chromosomal location that is different from its natural chromosomal location.                [0120] \"Isolated nucleic acid encoding an anti-PCSK9 antibody\" refers to one or more nucleic acid molecules encoding antibody heavy and light chains (or fragments thereof), including such nucleic acid molecule(s) in a single vector or separate vectors, and such nucleic acid molecule(s) present at one or more locations in a host cell.                [0121] The term \"monoclonal antibody,\" as used herein, refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical and/or bind the same epitope, except for possible variant antibodies, e.g., containing naturally occurring mutations or arising during production of a monoclonal antibody preparation, such variants generally being present in minor amounts. In contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations, which typically include different antibodies directed against different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody of a monoclonal antibody preparation is directed against a single determinant on an antigen. Thus, the modifier \"monoclonal\" indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example, the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by a variety of techniques, including but not limited to the hybridoma method, recombinant DNA methods, phage-display methods, and methods utilizing transgenic animals containing all or part of the human immunoglobulin loci, such methods and other exemplary methods for making monoclonal antibodies being described herein.                [0122] A \"naked antibody\" refers to an antibody that is not conjugated to a heterologous moiety (e.g., a cytotoxic moiety) or radiolabel. The naked antibody may be present in a pharmaceutical formulation.                [0123] \"Native antibodies\" refer to naturally occurring immunoglobulin molecules with varying structures. For example, native IgG antibodies are heterotetrameric glycoproteins of about 150,000 daltons, composed of two identical light chains and two identical heavy chains that are disulfide-bonded. From N- to C-terminus, each heavy chain has a variable region (VH), also called a variable heavy domain or a heavy chain variable domain, followed by three constant domains (CH1, CH2, and CH3). Similarly, from N- to C-terminus, each light chain has a variable region (VL), also called a variable light domain or a light chain variable domain, followed by a constant light (CL) domain. The light chain of an antibody may be assigned to one of two types, called kappa (.kappa.) and lambda (.lamda.), based on the amino acid sequence of its constant domain.                [0124] The term \"package insert\" is used to refer to instructions customarily included in commercial packages of therapeutic products, that contain information about the indications, usage, dosage, administration, combination therapy, contraindications and/or warnings concerning the use of such therapeutic products.                [0125] \"Percent (%) amino acid sequence identity\" with respect to a reference polypeptide sequence is defined as the percentage of amino acid residues in a candidate sequence that are identical with the amino acid residues in the reference polypeptide sequence, after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity, and not considering any conservative substitutions as part of the sequence identity. Alignment for purposes of determining percent amino acid sequence identity can be achieved in various ways that are within the skill in the art, for instance, using publicly available computer software such as BLAST, BLAST-2, ALIGN or Megalign (DNASTAR) software. Those skilled in the art can determine appropriate parameters for aligning sequences, including any algorithms needed to achieve maximal alignment over the full length of the sequences being compared. For purposes herein, however, % amino acid sequence identity values are generated using the sequence comparison computer program ALIGN-2. The ALIGN-2 sequence comparison computer program was authored by Genentech, Inc., and the source code has been filed with user documentation in the U.S. Copyright Office, Washington D.C., 20559, where it is registered under U.S. Copyright Registration No. TXU510087. The ALIGN-2 program is publicly available from Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, Calif., or may be compiled from the source code. The ALIGN-2 program should be compiled for use on a UNIX operating system, including digital UNIX V4.0D. All sequence comparison parameters are set by the ALIGN-2 program and do not vary.                [0126] In situations where ALIGN-2 is employed for amino acid sequence comparisons, the % amino acid sequence identity of a given amino acid sequence A to, with, or against a given amino acid sequence B (which can alternatively be phrased as a given amino acid sequence A that has or comprises a certain % amino acid sequence identity to, with, or against a given amino acid sequence B) is calculated as follows:                100 times the fraction X/Y                where X is the number of amino acid residues scored as identical matches by the sequence alignment program ALIGN-2 in that program's alignment of A and B, and where Y is the total number of amino acid residues in B. It will be appreciated that where the length of amino acid sequence A is not equal to the length of amino acid sequence B, the % amino acid sequence identity of A to B will not equal the % amino acid sequence identity of B to A. Unless specifically stated otherwise, all % amino acid sequence identity values used herein are obtained as described in the immediately preceding paragraph using the ALIGN-2 computer program.                [0127] The term \"pharmaceutical formulation\" or \"pharmaceutical composition\" refers to a preparation which is in such form as to permit the biological activity of an active ingredient contained therein to be effective, and which contains no additional components which are unacceptably toxic to a subject to which the formulation would be administered.                [0128] A \"pharmaceutically acceptable carrier\" refers to an ingredient in a pharmaceutical formulation, other than an active ingredient, which is nontoxic to a subject. A pharmaceutically acceptable carrier includes, but is not limited to, a buffer, excipient, stabilizer, or preservative.                [0129] The term \"proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9,\" \"PCSK9,\" or \"NARC-1,\" as used herein, refers to any native PCSK9 from any vertebrate source, including mammals such as primates (e.g. humans) and rodents (e.g., mice and rats), unless otherwise indicated. The term encompasses \"full-length,\" unprocessed PCSK9 as well as any form of PCSK9 that results from processing in the cell or any fragment thereof. The term also encompasses naturally occurring variants of PCSK9, e.g., splice variants or allelic variants.                [0130] The term \"PCSK9 activity\" or \"biological activity\" of PCSK9, as used herein, includes any biological effect of PCSK9. In certain embodiments, PCSK9 activity includes the ability of PCSK9 to interact or bind to a substrate or receptor. In certain embodiments, the biological activity of PCSK9 is the ability of PCSK9 to bind to a LDL-receptor (LDLR). In certain embodiments, PCSK9 binds to and catalyzes a reaction involving LDLR. In certain embodiments, PCSK9 activity includes the ability of PCSK9 to decrease or reduce the availability of LDLR. In certain embodiments, the biological activity of PCSK9 includes the ability of PCSK9 to increase the amount of LDL in a subject. In certain embodiments, the biological activity of PCSK9 includes the ability of PCSK9 to decrease the amount of LDLR that is available to bind to LDL in a subject. In certain embodiments, the biological activity of PCSK9 includes the ability of PCSK9 to decrease the amount of LDLR that is available to bind to LDL. In certain embodiments, biological activity of PCSK9 includes any biological activity resulting from PCSK9 signaling.                [0131] \"Single-chain Fv\" or \"scFv\" antibody fragments comprise the VH and VL domains of antibody, wherein these domains are present in a single polypeptide chain. Generally, the scFv polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the VH and VL domains which enables the scFv to form the desired structure for antigen binding. For a review of scFv, see, e.g., Pluckthiin, in The Pharmacology of Monoclonal Antibodies, vol. 113, Rosenburg and Moore eds., (Springer-Verlag, New York, 1994), pp. 269-315.                [0132] As used herein, \"treatment\" (and grammatical variations thereof such as \"treat\" or \"treating\") refers to clinical intervention in an attempt to alter the natural course of the individual being treated, and can be performed either for prophylaxis or during the course of clinical pathology. Desirable effects of treatment include, but are not limited to, preventing occurrence or recurrence of disease, alleviation of symptoms, diminishment of any direct or indirect pathological consequences of the disease, decreasing the rate of disease progression, amelioration or palliation of the disease state, and remission or improved prognosis. In some embodiments, antibodies of the invention are used to delay development of a disease or to slow the progression of a disease.                [0133] The term \"variable region\" or \"variable domain\" refers to the domain of an antibody heavy or light chain that is involved in binding the antibody to antigen. The variable domains of the heavy chain and light chain (VH and VL, respectively) of a native antibody generally have similar structures, with each domain comprising four conserved framework regions (FRs) and three hypervariable regions (HVRs). (See, e.g., Kindt et al. Kuby Immunology, 6.sup.th ed., W.H. Freeman and Co., page 91 (2007)). A single VH or VL domain may be sufficient to confer antigen-binding specificity. Furthermore, antibodies that bind a particular antigen may be isolated using a VH or VL domain from an antibody that binds the antigen to screen a library of complementary VL or VH domains, respectively. See, e.g., Portolano et al., J. Immunol. 150:880-887 (1993); Clarkson et al., Nature 352:624-628 (1991).                [0134] The term \"vector,\" as used herein, refers to a nucleic acid molecule capable of propagating another nucleic acid to which it is linked. The term includes the vector as a self-replicating nucleic acid structure as well as the vector incorporated into the genome of a host cell into which it has been introduced. Certain vectors are capable of directing the expression of nucleic acids to which they are operatively linked. Such vectors are referred to herein as \"expression vectors.\"                II. COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS                [0135] In one aspect, the invention is based, in part, on experimental results obtained with anti-PCSK9 antibodies. Results obtained indicate that blocking biological activity of PCSK9 with anti-PCSK9 antibodies leads to a prevention of reduction in LDLR. In addition, the results demonstrate that administration of anti-PCSK9 antibody reduces total LDL-cholesterol level in a subject. Accordingly, PCSK9 antibodies of the invention, as described herein, provide important therapeutic and diagnostic agents for use in targeting pathological conditions associated with PCSK9, e.g., cholesterol related disorders.                [0136] In certain embodiments, a \"cholesterol related disorder\" includes any one or more of the following: hypercholesterolemia, heart disease, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke, cardiovascular diseases, Alzheimers disease and generally dyslipidemias, which can be manifested, for example, by an elevated total serum cholesterol, elevated LDL, elevated triglycerides, elevated VLDL, and/or low HDL. Some non-limiting examples of primary and secondary dyslipidemias that can be treated using an anti-PCSK9 antibody, either alone, or in combination with one or more other agents include the metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus, familial combined hyperlipidemia, familial hypertriglyceridemia, familial hypercholesterolemias, including heterozygous hypercholesterolemia, homozygous hypercholesterolemia, familial defective apoplipoprotein B-100; polygenic hypercholesterolemia; remnant removal disease, hepatic lipase deficiency; dyslipidemia secondary to any of the following: dietary indiscretion, hypothyroidism, drugs including estrogen and progestin therapy, beta-blockers, and thiazide diuretics; nephrotic syndrome, chronic renal failure, Cushing's syndrome, primary biliary cirrhosis, glycogen storage diseases, hepatoma, cholestasis, acromegaly, insulinoma, isolated growth hormone deficiency, and alcohol-induced hypertriglyceridemia. Anti-PCSK9 antibodies described herein can also be useful in preventing or treating atherosclerotic diseases, such as, for example, coronary heart disease, coronary artery disease, peripheral arterial disease, stroke (ischaemic and hemorrhagic), angina pectoris, or cerebrovascular disease and acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction. In certain embodiments, the anti-PCSK9 antibodies described herein are useful in reducing the risk of: nonfatal heart attacks, fatal and non-fatal strokes, certain types of heart surgery, hospitalization for heart failure, chest pain in patients with heart disease, and/or cardiovascular events because of established heart disease such as prior heart attack, prior heart surgery, and/or chest pain with evidence of clogged arteries. In certain embodiments, the anti-PCSK9 antibodies and methods described herein can be used to reduce the risk of recurrent cardiovascular events.                [0137] A. Exemplary Anti-PC SK9 Antibodies                [0138] In one aspect, the invention provides isolated antibodies that bind to PCSK9.

[0149] In certain embodiments, functional epitopes can be mapped by combinatorial alanine scanning. In this process, a combinatorial alanine-scanning strategy can be used to identify amino acids in the PCSK9 protein that are necessary for interaction with anti-PCSK9 antibodies.

[0152] In a further aspect of the invention, an anti-PCSK9 antibody according to any of the above embodiment is a monoclonal antibody, including a chimeric, humanized or human antibody. In one embodiment, an anti-PCSK9 antibody is an antibody fragment, e.g., a Fv, Fab, Fab', scFv, diabody, or F(ab').sub.2 fragment. In another embodiment, the antibody is a full length antibody, e.g., an intact IgG.sub.1 antibody or other antibody class or isotype as defined herein.                [0153] In a further aspect, an anti-PCSK9 antibody according to any of the above embodiments may incorporate any of the features, singly or in combination, as described in Sections 1-7 below:                [0154] 1. Antibody Affinity                [0155] In certain embodiments, an antibody provided herein has a dissociation constant (Kd) of .ltoreq.1 .mu.M, .ltoreq.100 nM, .ltoreq.10 nM, .ltoreq.1 nM, .ltoreq.0.1 nM, .ltoreq.0.01 nM, or .ltoreq.0.001 nM (e.g. 10.sup.-8M or less, e.g. from 10.sup.-8M to 10.sup.-13M, e.g., from 10.sup.-9M to 10.sup.-13 M).                [0156] In one embodiment, Kd is measured by a radiolabeled antigen binding assay (RIA) performed with the Fab version of an antibody of interest and its antigen as described by the following assay. Solution binding affinity of Fabs for antigen is measured by equilibrating Fab with a minimal concentration of (.sup.125I)-labeled antigen in the presence of a titration series of unlabeled antigen, then capturing bound antigen with an anti-Fab antibody-coated plate (see, e.g., Chen et al., J. Mol. Biol. 293:865-881 (1999)). To establish conditions for the assay, MICROTITER.RTM. multi-well plates (Thermo Scientific) are coated overnight with 5 .mu.g/ml of a capturing anti-Fab antibody (Cappel Labs) in 50 mM sodium carbonate (pH 9.6), and subsequently blocked with 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS for two to five hours at room temperature (approximately 23.degree. C.). In a non-adsorbent plate (Nunc #269620), 100 pM or 26 pM [.sup.125I]-antigen are mixed with serial dilutions of a Fab of interest (e.g., consistent with assessment of the anti-VEGF antibody, Fab-12, in Presta et al., Cancer Res. 57:4593-4599 (1997)). The Fab of interest is then incubated overnight; however, the incubation may continue for a longer period (e.g., about 65 hours) to ensure that equilibrium is reached. Thereafter, the mixtures are transferred to the capture plate for incubation at room temperature (e.g., for one hour). The solution is then removed and the plate washed eight times with 0.1% polysorbate 20 (TWEEN-20) in PBS. When the plates have dried, 150 .mu.l/well of scintillant (MICROSCINT-20.TM.; Packard) is added, and the plates are counted on a TOPCOUNT.TM. gamma counter (Packard) for ten minutes. Concentrations of each Fab that give less than or equal to 20% of maximal binding are chosen for use in competitive binding assays.                [0157] According to another embodiment, Kd is measured using surface plasmon resonance assays using a BIACORE.RTM.-2000 or a BIACORE.RTM.-3000 (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, N.J.) at 25.degree. C. with immobilized antigen CM5 chips at .about.10 response units (RU). Briefly, carboxymethylated dextran biosensor chips (CM5, BIACORE, Inc.) are activated with N-ethyl-N'-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) according to the supplier's instructions. Antigen is diluted with 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.8, to 5 .mu.g/ml (.about.0.2 .mu.M) before injection at a flow rate of 5 .mu.l/minute to achieve approximately 10 response units (RU) of coupled protein. Following the injection of antigen, 1 M ethanolamine is injected to block unreacted groups. For kinetics measurements, two-fold serial dilutions of Fab (0.78 nM to 500 nM) are injected in PBS with 0.05% polysorbate 20 (TWEEN-20.TM.) surfactant (PBST) at 25.degree. C. at a flow rate of approximately 25 .mu.l/min. Association rates (k.sub.on) and dissociation rates (k.sub.off) are calculated using a simple one-to-one Langmuir binding model (BIACORE.RTM. Evaluation Software version 3.2) by simultaneously fitting the association and dissociation sensorgrams. The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) is calculated as the ratio k.sub.off/k.sub.on. See, e.g., Chen et al., J. Mol. Biol. 293:865-881 (1999). If the on-rate exceeds 10.sup.6 M.sup.-1 5.sup.-1 by the surface plasmon resonance assay above, then the on-rate can be determined by using a fluorescent quenching technique that measures the increase or decrease in fluorescence emission intensity (excitation=295 nm; emission=340 nm, 16 nm band-pass) at 25.degree. C. of a 20 nM anti-antigen antibody (Fab form) in PBS, pH 7.2, in the presence of increasing concentrations of antigen as measured in a spectrometer, such as a stop-flow equipped spectrophometer (Aviv Instruments) or a 8000-series SLM-AMINCO.TM. spectrophotometer (ThermoSpectronic) with a stirred cuvette.                [0158] 2. Antibody Fragments                [0159] In certain embodiments, an antibody provided herein is an antibody fragment. Antibody fragments include, but are not limited to, Fab, Fab', Fab'-SH, F(ab').sub.2, Fv, and scFv fragments, and other fragments described below. For a review of certain antibody fragments, see Hudson et al. Nat. Med. 9:129-134 (2003). For a review of scFv fragments, see, e.g., Pluckthun, in The Pharmacology of Monoclonal Antibodies, vol. 113, Rosenburg and Moore eds., (Springer-Verlag, New York), pp. 269-315 (1994); see also WO 93/16185; and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,571,894 and 5,587,458. For discussion of Fab and F(ab).sub.2 fragments comprising salvage receptor binding epitope residues and having increased in vivo half-life, see U.S. Pat. No. 5,869,046.                [0160] Diabodies are antibody fragments with two antigen-binding sites that may be bivalent or bispecific. See, for example, EP 404,097; WO 1993/01161; Hudson et al., Nat. Med. 9:129-134 (2003); and Hollinger et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90: 6444-6448 (1993). Triabodies and tetrabodies are also described in Hudson et al., Nat. Med. 9:129-134 (2003).                [0161] Single-domain antibodies are antibody fragments comprising all or a portion of the heavy chain variable domain or all or a portion of the light chain variable domain of an antibody. In certain embodiments, a single-domain antibody is a human single-domain antibody (Domantis, Inc., Waltham, Mass.; see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,248,516 B1).                [0162] Antibody fragments can be made by various techniques, including but not limited to proteolytic digestion of an intact antibody as well as production by recombinant host cells (e.g. E. coli or phage), as described herein.                [0163] 3. Chimeric and Humanized Antibodies                [0164] In certain embodiments, an antibody provided herein is a chimeric antibody. Certain chimeric antibodies are described, e.g., in U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; and Morrison et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 81:6851-6855 (1984)). In one example, a chimeric antibody comprises a non-human variable region (e.g., a variable region derived from a mouse, rat, hamster, rabbit, or non-human primate, such as a monkey) and a human constant region. In a further example, a chimeric antibody is a \"class switched\" antibody in which the class or subclass has been changed from that of the parent antibody. Chimeric antibodies include antigen-binding fragments thereof.                [0165] In certain embodiments, a chimeric antibody is a humanized antibody. Typically, a non-human antibody is humanized to reduce immunogenicity to humans, while retaining the specificity and affinity of the parental non-human antibody. Generally, a humanized antibody comprises one or more variable domains in which HVRs, e.g., CDRs, (or portions thereof) are derived from a non-human antibody, and FRs (or portions thereof) are derived from human antibody sequences. A humanized antibody optionally will also comprise at least a portion of a human constant region. In some embodiments, some FR residues in a humanized antibody are substituted with corresponding residues from a non-human antibody (e.g., the antibody from which the HVR residues are derived), e.g., to restore or improve antibody specificity or affinity.                [0166] Humanized antibodies and methods of making them are reviewed, e.g., in Almagro and Fransson, Front. Biosci. 13:1619-1633 (2008), and are further described, e.g., in Riechmann et al., Nature 332:323-329 (1988); Queen et al., Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA 86:10029-10033 (1989); U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,821,337, 7,527,791, 6,982,321, and 7,087,409; Kashmiri et al., Methods 36:25-34 (2005) (describing SDR (a-CDR) grafting); Padlan, Mol. Immunol. 28:489-498 (1991) (describing \"resurfacing\"); Dall'Acqua et al., Methods 36:43-60 (2005) (describing \"FR shuffling\"); and Osbourn et al., Methods 36:61-68 (2005) and Klimka et al., Br. J. Cancer, 83:252-260 (2000) (describing the \"guided selection\" approach to FR shuffling).                [0167] Human framework regions that may be used for humanization include but are not limited to: framework regions selected using the \"best-fit\" method (see, e.g., Sims et al. J. Immunol. 151:2296 (1993)); framework regions derived from the consensus sequence of human antibodies of a particular subgroup of light or heavy chain variable regions (see, e.g., Carter et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 89:4285 (1992); and Presta et al. J. Immunol., 151:2623 (1993)); human mature (somatically mutated) framework regions or human germline framework regions (see, e.g., Almagro and Fransson, Front. Biosci. 13:1619-1633 (2008)); and framework regions derived from screening FR libraries (see, e.g., Baca et al., J. Biol. Chem. 272:10678-10684 (1997) and Rosok et al., J. Biol. Chem. 271:22611-22618 (1996)).                [0168] 4. Human Antibodies                [0169] In certain embodiments, an antibody provided herein is a human antibody. Human antibodies can be produced using various techniques known in the art. Human antibodies are described generally in van Dijk and van de Winkel, Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 5: 368-74 (2001) and Lonberg, Curr. Opin. Immunol. 20:450-459 (2008).                [0170] Human antibodies may be prepared by administering an immunogen to a transgenic animal that has been modified to produce intact human antibodies or intact antibodies with human variable regions in response to antigenic challenge. Such animals typically contain all or a portion of the human immunoglobulin loci, which replace the endogenous immunoglobulin loci, or which are present extrachromosomally or integrated randomly into the animal's chromosomes. In such transgenic mice, the endogenous immunoglobulin loci have generally been inactivated. For review of methods for obtaining human antibodies from transgenic animals, see Lonberg, Nat. Biotech. 23:1117-1125 (2005). See also, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,075,181 and 6,150,584 describing XENOMOUSE.TM. technology; U.S. Pat. No. 5,770,429 describing HuMAB.RTM. technology; U.S. Pat. No. 7,041,870 describing K-M MOUSE.RTM. technology, and U.S. Patent Application Publication No. US 2007/0061900, describing VELOCIMOUSE.RTM. technology). Human variable regions from intact antibodies generated by such animals may be further modified, e.g., by combining with a different human constant region.                [0171] Human antibodies can also be made by hybridoma-based methods. Human myeloma and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines for the production of human monoclonal antibodies have been described. (See, e.g., Kozbor J. Immunol., 133: 3001 (1984); Brodeur et al., Monoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications, pp. 51-63 (Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1987); and Boerner et al., J. Immunol., 147: 86 (1991).) Human antibodies generated via human B-cell hybridoma technology are also described in Li et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 103:3557-3562 (2006). Additional methods include those described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 7,189,826 (describing production of monoclonal human IgM antibodies from hybridoma cell lines) and Ni, Xiandai Mianyixue, 26(4):265-268 (2006) (describing human-human hybridomas). Human hybridoma technology (Trioma technology) is also described in Vollmers and Brandlein, Histology and Histopathology, 20(3):927-937 (2005) and Vollmers and Brandlein, Methods and Findings in Experimental and Clinical Pharmacology, 27(3):185-91 (2005).                [0172] Human antibodies may also be generated by isolating Fv clone variable domain sequences selected from human-derived phage display libraries. Such variable domain sequences may then be combined with a desired human constant domain. Techniques for selecting human antibodies from antibody libraries are described below.                [0173] 5. Library-Derived Antibodies                [0174] Antibodies of the invention may be isolated by screening combinatorial libraries for antibodies with the desired activity or activities. For example, a variety of methods are known in the art for generating phage display libraries and screening such libraries for antibodies possessing the desired binding characteristics. Such methods are reviewed, e.g., in Hoogenboom et al. in Methods in Molecular Biology 178:1-37 (O'Brien et al., ed., Human Press, Totowa, N.J., 2001) and further described, e.g., in the McCafferty et al., Nature 348:552-554; Clackson et al., Nature 352: 624-628 (1991); Marks et al., J. Mol. Biol. 222: 581-597 (1992); Marks and Bradbury, in Methods in Molecular Biology 248:161-175 (Lo, ed., Human Press, Totowa, N.J., 2003); Sidhu et al., J. Mol. Biol. 338(2): 299-310 (2004); Lee et al., J. Mol. Biol. 340(5): 1073-1093 (2004); Fellouse, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 101(34): 12467-12472 (2004); and Lee et al., J. Immunol. Methods 284(1-2): 119-132 (2004).                [0175] In certain phage display methods, repertoires of VH and VL genes are separately cloned by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and recombined randomly in phage libraries, which can then be screened for antigen-binding phage as described in Winter et al., Ann. Rev. Immunol., 12: 433-455 (1994). Phage typically display antibody fragments, either as single-chain Fv (scFv) fragments or as Fab fragments. Libraries from immunized sources provide high-affinity antibodies to the immunogen without the requirement of constructing hybridomas. Alternatively, the naive repertoire can be cloned (e.g., from human) to provide a single source of antibodies to a wide range of non-self and also self antigens without any immunization as described by Griffiths et al., EMBO J, 12: 725-734 (1993). Finally, naive libraries can also be made synthetically by cloning unrearranged V-gene segments from stem cells, and using PCR primers containing random sequence to encode the highly variable CDR3 regions and to accomplish rearrangement in vitro, as described by Hoogenboom and Winter, J. Mol. Biol., 227: 381-388 (1992). Patent publications describing human antibody phage libraries include, for example: U.S. Pat. No. 5,750,373, and US Patent Publication Nos. 2005/0079574, 2005/0119455, 2005/0266000, 2007/0117126, 2007/0160598, 2007/0237764, 2007/0292936, and 2009/0002360.                [0176] Antibodies or antibody fragments isolated from human antibody libraries are considered human antibodies or human antibody fragments herein.                [0177] 6. Multispecific Antibodies                [0178] In certain embodiments, an antibody provided herein is a multispecific antibody, e.g. a bispecific antibody. Multispecific antibodies are monoclonal antibodies that have binding specificities for at least two different sites. In certain embodiments, one of the binding specificities is for PCSK9 and the other is for any other antigen. In certain embodiments, bispecific antibodies may bind to two different epitopes of PCSK9. Bispecific antibodies may also be used to localize cytotoxic agents to cells which express PCSK9. Bispecific antibodies can be prepared as full length antibodies or antibody fragments.                [0179] Techniques for making multispecific antibodies include, but are not limited to, recombinant co-expression of two immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pairs having different specificities (see Milstein and Cuello, Nature 305: 537 (1983)), WO 93/08829, and Traunecker et al., EMBO J. 10: 3655 (1991)), and \"knob-in-hole\" engineering (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,731,168). Multi-specific antibodies may also be made by engineering electrostatic steering effects for making antibody Fc-heterodimeric molecules (WO 2009/089004A1); cross-linking two or more antibodies or fragments (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,676,980, and Brennan et al., Science, 229: 81 (1985)); using leucine zippers to produce bi-specific antibodies (see, e.g., Kostelny et al., J. Immunol., 148(5):1547-1553 (1992)); using \"diabody\" technology for making bispecific antibody fragments (see, e.g., Hollinger et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 90:6444-6448 (1993)); and using single-chain Fv (sFv) dimers (see, e.g., Gruber et al., J. Immunol., 152:5368 (1994)); and preparing trispecific antibodies as described, e.g., in Tutt et al. J. Immunol. 147: 60 (1991).                [0180] Engineered antibodies with three or more functional antigen binding sites, including \"Octopus antibodies,\" are also included herein (see, e.g., US 2006/0025576A1).                [0181] The antibody or fragment herein also includes a \"Dual Acting FAb\" or \"DAF\" comprising an antigen binding site that binds to PCSK9 as well as another, different antigen (see, e.g., US 2008/0069820).                [0182] 7. Antibody Variants                [0183] In certain embodiments, amino acid sequence variants of the antibodies provided herein are contemplated. For example, it may be desirable to improve the binding affinity and/or other biological properties of the antibody. Amino acid sequence variants of an antibody may be prepared by introducing appropriate modifications into the nucleotide sequence encoding the antibody, or by peptide synthesis. Such modifications include, for example, deletions from, and/or insertions into and/or substitutions of residues within the amino acid sequences of the antibody.                [0184] Any combination of deletion, insertion, and substitution can be made to arrive at the final construct, provided that the final construct possesses the desired characteristics, e.g., antigen-binding.                [0185] a) Substitution, Insertion, and Deletion Variants                [0186] In certain embodiments, antibody variants having one or more amino acid substitutions are provided. Sites of interest for substitutional mutagenesis include the HVRs and FRs. Conservative substitutions are shown in Table 1 under the heading of \"conservative substitutions.\" More substantial changes are provided in Table 1 under the heading of \"exemplary substitutions,\" and as further described below in reference to amino acid side chain classes. Amino acid substitutions may be introduced into an antibody of interest and the products screened for a desired activity, e.g., retained/improved antigen binding, decreased immunogenicity, or improved ADCC or CDC.                TABLE-US-00001 TABLE 1 Original Exemplary Preferred Residue Substitutions Substitutions Ala (A) Val; Leu; Ile Val Arg (R) Lys; Gln; Asn Lys Asn (N) Gln; His; Asp, Lys; Arg Gln Asp (D) Glu; Asn Glu Cys (C) Ser; Ala Ser Gln (Q) Asn; Glu Asn Glu (E) Asp; Gln Asp Gly (G) Ala Ala His (H) Asn; Gln; Lys; Arg Arg Ile (I) Leu; Val; Met; Ala; Phe; Norleucine Leu Leu (L) Norleucine; Ile; Val; Met; Ala; Phe Ile Lys (K) Arg; Gln; Asn Arg Met (M) Leu; Phe; Ile Leu Phe (F) Trp; Leu; Val; Ile; Ala; Tyr Tyr Pro (P) Ala Ala Ser (S) Thr Thr Thr (T) Val; Ser Ser Trp (W) Tyr; Phe Tyr Tyr (Y) Trp; Phe; Thr; Ser Phe Val (V) Ile; Leu; Met; Phe; Ala; Norleucine Leu                Amino acids may be grouped according to common side-chain properties:                [0187] (1) hydrophobic: Norleucine, Met, Ala, Val, Leu, Ile;                [0188] (2) neutral hydrophilic: Cys, Ser, Thr, Asn, Gln;                [0189] (3) acidic: Asp, Glu;                [0190] (4) basic: His, Lys, Arg;                [0191] (5) residues that influence chain orientation: Gly, Pro;                [0192] (6) aromatic: Trp, Tyr, Phe.                [0193] Non-conservative substitutions will entail exchanging a member of one of these classes for another class.                [0194] One type of substitutional variant involves substituting one or more hypervariable region residues of a parent antibody (e.g., a humanized or human antibody). Generally, the resulting variant(s) selected for further study will have modifications (e.g., improvements) in certain biological properties (e.g., increased affinity, reduced immunogenicity) relative to the parent antibody and/or will have substantially retained certain biological properties of the parent antibody. An exemplary substitutional variant is an affinity matured antibody, which may be conveniently generated, e.g., using phage display-based affinity maturation techniques such as those described herein. Briefly, one or more HVR residues are mutated and the variant antibodies displayed on phage and screened for a particular biological activity (e.g. binding affinity).                [0195] Alterations (e.g., substitutions) may be made in HVRs, e.g., to improve antibody affinity. Such alterations may be made in HVR \"hotspots,\" i.e., residues encoded by codons that undergo mutation at high frequency during the somatic maturation process (see, e.g., Chowdhury, Methods Mol. Biol. 207:179-196 (2008)), and/or SDRs (a-CDRs), with the resulting variant VH or VL being tested for binding affinity. Affinity maturation by constructing and reselecting from secondary libraries has been described, e.g., in Hoogenboom et al. in Methods in Molecular Biology 178:1-37 (O'Brien et al., ed., Human Press, Totowa, N.J., (2001).) In some embodiments of affinity maturation, diversity is introduced into the variable genes chosen for maturation by any of a variety of methods (e.g., error-prone PCR, chain shuffling, or oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis). A secondary library is then created. The library is then screened to identify any antibody variants with the desired affinity. Another method to introduce diversity involves HVR-directed approaches, in which several HVR residues (e.g., 4-6 residues at a time) are randomized. HVR residues involved in antigen binding may be specifically identified, e.g., using alanine scanning mutagenesis or modeling. CDR-H3 and CDR-L3 in particular are often targeted.                [0196] In certain embodiments, substitutions, insertions, or deletions may occur within one or more HVRs so long as such alterations do not substantially reduce the ability of the antibody to bind antigen. For example, conservative alterations (e.g., conservative substitutions as provided herein) that do not substantially reduce binding affinity may be made in HVRs. Such alterations may be outside of HVR \"hotspots\" or SDRs. In certain embodiments of the variant VH and VL sequences provided above, each HVR either is unaltered, or contains no more than one, two or three amino acid substitutions.                [0197] A useful method for identification of residues or regions of an antibody that may be targeted for mutagenesis is called \"alanine scanning mutagenesis\" as described by Cunningham and Wells (1989) Science, 244:1081-1085. In this method, a residue or group of target residues (e.g., charged residues such as arg, asp, his, lys, and glu) are identified and replaced by a neutral or negatively charged amino acid (e.g., alanine or polyalanine) to determine whether the interaction of the antibody with antigen is affected. Further substitutions may be introduced at the amino acid locations demonstrating functional sensitivity to the initial substitutions. Alternatively, or additionally, a crystal structure of an antigen-antibody complex to identify contact points between the antibody and antigen. Such contact residues and neighboring residues may be targeted or eliminated as candidates for substitution. Variants may be screened to determine whether they contain the desired properties.                [0198] Amino acid sequence insertions include amino- and/or carboxyl-terminal fusions ranging in length from one residue to polypeptides containing a hundred or more residues, as well as intrasequence insertions of single or multiple amino acid residues. Examples of terminal insertions include an antibody with an N-terminal methionyl residue. Other insertional variants of the antibody molecule include the fusion to the N- or C-terminus of the antibody to an enzyme (e.g., for ADEPT) or a polypeptide which increases the serum half-life of the antibody.                [0199] b) Glycosylation Variants                [0200] In certain embodiments, an antibody provided herein is altered to increase or decrease the extent to which the antibody is glycosylated. Addition or deletion of glycosylation sites to an antibody may be conveniently accomplished by altering the amino acid sequence such that one or more glycosylation sites is created or removed.                [0201] Where the antibody comprises an Fc region, the carbohydrate attached thereto may be altered. Native antibodies produced by mammalian cells typically comprise a branched, biantennary oligosaccharide that is generally attached by an N-linkage to Asn297 of the CH2 domain of the Fc region. See, e.g., Wright et al. TIBTECH 15:26-32 (1997). The oligosaccharide may include various carbohydrates, e.g., mannose, N-acetyl glucosamine (G1cNAc), galactose, and sialic acid, as well as a fucose attached to a GlcNAc in the \"stem\" of the biantennary oligosaccharide structure. In some embodiments, modifications of the oligosaccharide in an antibody of the invention may be made in order to create antibody variants with certain improved properties.                [0202] In one embodiment, antibody variants are provided having a carbohydrate structure that lacks fucose attached (directly or indirectly) to an Fc region. For example, the amount of fucose in such antibody may be from 1% to 80%, from 1% to 65%, from 5% to 65% or from 20% to 40%. The amount of fucose is determined by calculating the average amount of fucose within the sugar chain at Asn297, relative to the sum of all glycostructures attached to Asn 297 (e.g., complex, hybrid and high mannose structures) as measured by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, as described in WO 2008/077546, for example. Asn297 refers to the asparagine residue located at about position 297 in the Fc region (EU numbering of Fc region residues); however, Asn297 may also be located about +3 amino acids upstream or downstream of position 297, i.e., between positions 294 and 300, due to minor sequence variations in antibodies. Such fucosylation variants may have improved ADCC function. See, e.g., US Patent Publication Nos. US 2003/0157108 (Presta, L.); US 2004/0093621 (Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co., Ltd). Examples of publications related to \"defucosylated\" or \"fucose-deficient\" antibody variants include: US 2003/0157108; WO 2000/61739; WO 2001/29246; US 2003/0115614; US 2002/0164328; US 2004/0093621; US 2004/0132140; US 2004/0110704; US 2004/0110282; US 2004/0109865; WO 2003/085119; WO 2003/084570; WO 2005/035586; WO 2005/035778; WO2005/053742; WO2002/031140; Okazaki et al. J. Mol. Biol. 336:1239-1249 (2004); Yamane-Ohnuki et al. Biotech. Bioeng. 87: 614 (2004). Examples of cell lines capable of producing defucosylated antibodies include Lec13 CHO cells deficient in protein fucosylation (Ripka et al. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 249:533-545 (1986); US Patent Application No. US 2003/0157108 A1, Presta, L; and WO 2004/056312 A1, Adams et al., especially at Example 11), and knockout cell lines, such as alpha-1,6-fucosyltransferase gene, FUT8, knockout CHO cells (see, e.g., Yamane-Ohnuki et al. Biotech. Bioeng. 87: 614 (2004); Kanda, Y. et al., Biotechnol. Bioeng., 94(4):680-688 (2006); and WO2003/085107).                [0203] Antibodies variants are further provided with bisected oligosaccharides, e.g., in which a biantennary oligosaccharide attached to the Fc region of the antibody is bisected by GlcNAc. Such antibody variants may have reduced fucosylation and/or improved ADCC function. Examples of such antibody variants are described, e.g., in WO 2003/011878 (Jean-Mairet et al.); U.S. Pat. No. 6,602,684 (Umana et al.); and US 2005/0123546 (Umana et al.). Antibody variants with at least one galactose residue in the oligosaccharide attached to the Fc region are also provided. Such antibody variants may have improved CDC function. Such antibody variants are described, e.g., in WO 1997/30087 (Patel et al.); WO 1998/58964 (Raju, S.); and WO 1999/22764 (Raju, S.).                [0204] c) Fc Region Variants                [0205] In certain embodiments, one or more amino acid modifications may be introduced into the Fc region of an antibody provided herein, thereby generating an Fc region variant. The Fc region variant may comprise a human Fc region sequence (e.g., a human IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 or IgG4 Fc region) comprising an amino acid modification (e.g. a substitution) at one or more amino acid positions.                [0206] In certain embodiments, the invention contemplates an antibody variant that possesses some but not all effector functions, which make it a desirable candidate for applications in which the half life of the antibody in vivo is important yet certain effector functions (such as complement and ADCC) are unnecessary or deleterious. In vitro and/or in vivo cytotoxicity assays can be conducted to confirm the reduction/depletion of CDC and/or ADCC activities. For example, Fc receptor (FcR) binding assays can be conducted to ensure that the antibody lacks Fc.gamma.R binding (hence likely lacking ADCC activity), but retains FcRn binding ability. The primary cells for mediating ADCC, NK cells, express Fc.gamma.RIII only, whereas monocytes express Fc.gamma.RI, Fc.gamma.RII and Fc.gamma.RIII. FcR expression on hematopoietic cells is summarized in Table 3 on page 464 of Ravetch and Kinet, Annu. Rev. Immunol. 9:457-492 (1991). Non-limiting examples of in vitro assays to assess ADCC activity of a molecule of interest is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,500,362 (see, e.g. Hellstrom, I. et al. Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA 83:7059-7063 (1986)) and Hellstrom, I et al., Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA 82:1499-1502 (1985); U.S. Pat. No. 5,821,337 (see Bruggemann, M. et al., J. Exp. Med. 166:1351-1361 (1987)). Alternatively, non-radioactive assays methods may be employed (see, for example, ACTI.TM. non-radioactive cytotoxicity assay for flow cytometry (CellTechnology, Inc. Mountain View, Calif.; and CytoTox 96.RTM. non-radioactive cytotoxicity assay (Promega, Madison, Wis.). Useful effector cells for such assays include peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and Natural Killer (NK) cells. Alternatively, or additionally, ADCC activity of the molecule of interest may be assessed in vivo, e.g., in a animal model such as that disclosed in Clynes et al. Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA 95:652-656 (1998). Clq binding assays may also be carried out to confirm that the antibody is unable to bind Clq and hence lacks CDC activity. See, e.g., Clq and C3c binding ELISA in WO 2006/029879 and WO 2005/100402. To assess complement activation, a CDC assay may be performed (see, for example, Gazzano-Santoro et al., J. Immunol. Methods 202:163 (1996); Cragg, M. S. et al., Blood 101:1045-1052 (2003); and Cragg, M. S, and M. J. Glennie, Blood 103:2738-2743 (2004)). FcRn binding and in vivo clearance/half life determinations can also be performed using methods known in the art (see, e.g., Petkova, S. B. et al., Int'l Immunol. 18(12):1759-1769 (2006)).                [0207] Antibodies with reduced effector function include those with substitution of one or more of Fc region residues 238, 265, 269, 270, 297, 327 and 329 (U.S. Pat. No. 6,737,056). Such Fc mutants include Fc mutants with substitutions at two or more of amino acid positions 265, 269, 270, 297 and 327, including the so-called \"DANA\" Fc mutant with substitution of residues 265 and 297 to alanine (U.S. Pat. No. 7,332,581).                [0208] Certain antibody variants with improved or diminished binding to FcRs are described. (See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,737,056; WO 2004/056312, and Shields et al., J. Biol. Chem. 9(2): 6591-6604 (2001).)                [0209] In certain embodiments, an antibody variant comprises an Fc region with one or more amino acid substitutions which improve ADCC, e.g., substitutions at positions 298, 333, and/or 334 of the Fc region (EU numbering of residues).                [0210] In some embodiments, alterations are made in the Fc region that result in altered (i.e., either improved or diminished) Clq binding and/or Complement Dependent Cytotoxicity (CDC), e.g., as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,194,551, WO 99/51642, and Idusogie et al. J. Immunol. 164: 4178-4184 (2000).                [0211] Antibodies with increased half lives and improved binding to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), which is responsible for the transfer of maternal IgGs to the fetus (Guyer et al., J. Immunol. 117:587 (1976) and Kim et al., J. Immunol. 24:249 (1994)), are described in US2005/0014934A1 (Hinton et al.). Those antibodies comprise an Fc region with one or more substitutions therein which improve binding of the Fc region to FcRn. Such Fc variants include those with substitutions at one or more of Fc region residues: 238, 256, 265, 272, 286, 303, 305, 307, 311, 312, 317, 340, 356, 360, 362, 376, 378, 380, 382, 413, 424 or 434, e.g., substitution of Fc region residue 434 (U.S. Pat. No. 7,371,826).                [0212] See also Duncan & Winter, Nature 322:738-40 (1988); U.S. Pat. No. 5,648,260; U.S. Pat. No. 5,624,821; and WO 94/29351 concerning other examples of Fc region variants.                [0213] d) Cysteine Engineered Antibody Variants                [0214] In certain embodiments, it may be desirable to create cysteine engineered antibodies, e.g., \"thioMAbs,\" in which one or more residues of an antibody are substituted with cysteine residues. In particular embodiments, the substituted residues occur at accessible sites of the antibody. By substituting those residues with cysteine, reactive thiol groups are thereby positioned at accessible sites of the antibody and may be used to conjugate the antibody to other moieties, such as drug moieties or linker-drug moieties, to create an immunoconjugate, as described further herein. In certain embodiments, any one or more of the following residues may be substituted with cysteine: V205 (Kabat numbering) of the light chain; A118 (EU numbering) of the heavy chain; and S400 (EU numbering) of the heavy chain Fc region. Cysteine engineered antibodies may be generated as described, e.g., in U.S. Pat. No. 7,521,541.                [0215] e) Antibody Derivatives                [0216] In certain embodiments, an antibody provided herein may be further modified to contain additional nonproteinaceous moieties that are known in the art and readily available. The moieties suitable for derivatization of the antibody include but are not limited to water soluble polymers. Non-limiting examples of water soluble polymers include, but are not limited to, polyethylene glycol (PEG), copolymers of ethylene glycol/propylene glycol, carboxymethylcellulose, dextran, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, poly-1,3-dioxolane, poly-1,3,6-trioxane, ethylene/maleic anhydride copolymer, polyaminoacids (either homopolymers or random copolymers), and dextran or poly(n-vinyl pyrrolidone)polyethylene glycol, propropylene glycol homopolymers, prolypropylene oxide/ethylene oxide co-polymers, polyoxyethylated polyols (e.g., glycerol), polyvinyl alcohol, and mixtures thereof. Polyethylene glycol propionaldehyde may have advantages in manufacturing due to its stability in water. The polymer may be of any molecular weight, and may be branched or unbranched. The number of polymers attached to the antibody may vary, and if more than one polymer are attached, they can be the same or different molecules. In general, the number and/or type of polymers used for derivatization can be determined based on considerations including, but not limited to, the particular properties or functions of the antibody to be improved, whether the antibody derivative will be used in a therapy under defined conditions, etc.                [0217] In another embodiment, conjugates of an antibody and nonproteinaceous moiety that may be selectively heated by exposure to radiation are provided. In one embodiment, the nonproteinaceous moiety is a carbon nanotube (Kam et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 102: 11600-11605 (2005)). The radiation may be of any wavelength, and includes, but is not limited to, wavelengths that do not harm ordinary cells, but which heat the nonproteinaceous moiety to a temperature at which cells proximal to the antibody-nonproteinaceous moiety are killed.                [0218] B. Recombinant Methods and Compositions                [0219] Anti-PCSK9 antibodies described herein may be produced using recombinant methods and compositions, e.g., as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567. In one embodiment, isolated nucleic acid encoding an anti-PCSK9 antibody described herein is provided. Such nucleic acid may encode an amino acid sequence comprising the VL and/or an amino acid sequence comprising the VH of the antibody (e.g., the light and/or heavy chains of the antibody). In a further embodiment, one or more vectors (e.g., expression vectors) comprising such nucleic acid are provided. In a further embodiment, a host cell comprising such nucleic acid is provided. In one such embodiment, a host cell comprises (e.g., has been transformed with): (1) a vector comprising a nucleic acid that encodes an amino acid sequence comprising the VL of the antibody and an amino acid sequence comprising the VH of the antibody, or (2) a first vector comprising a nucleic acid that encodes an amino acid sequence comprising the VL of the antibody and a second vector comprising a nucleic acid that encodes an amino acid sequence comprising the VH of the antibody. In one embodiment, the host cell is eukaryotic, e.g. a Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell or lymphoid cell (e.g., YO, NSO, Sp20 cell). In one embodiment, a method of making an anti-PCSK9 antibody is provided, wherein the method comprises culturing a host cell comprising a nucleic acid encoding the antibody, as provided above, under conditions suitable for expression of the antibody, and optionally recovering the antibody from the host cell (or host cell culture medium).                [0220] For recombinant production of an anti-PCSK9 antibody, nucleic acid encoding an antibody, e.g., as described above, is isolated and inserted into one or more vectors for further cloning and/or expression in a host cell. Such nucleic acid may be readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of the antibody).                [0221] Suitable host cells for cloning or expression of antibody-encoding vectors include prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells described herein. For example, antibodies may be produced in bacteria, in particular when glycosylation and Fc effector function are not needed. For expression of antibody fragments and polypeptides in bacteria, see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,648,237, 5,789,199, and 5,840,523. (See also Charlton, Methods in Molecular Biology, Vol. 248 (B. K. C. Lo, ed., Humana Press, Totowa, N.J., 2003), pp. 245-254, describing expression of antibody fragments in E. coli.). After expression, the antibody may be isolated from the bacterial cell paste in a soluble fraction and can be further purified.                [0222] In addition to prokaryotes, eukaryotic microbes such as filamentous fungi or yeast are suitable cloning or expression hosts for antibody-encoding vectors, including fungi and yeast strains whose glycosylation pathways have been \"humanized,\" resulting in the production of an antibody with a partially or fully human glycosylation pattern. See Gerngross, Nat. Biotech. 22:1409-1414 (2004), and Li et al., Nat. Biotech. 24:210-215 (2006).                [0223] Suitable host cells for the expression of glycosylated antibody are also derived from multicellular organisms (invertebrates and vertebrates). Examples of invertebrate cells include plant and insect cells. Numerous baculoviral strains have been identified which may be used in conjunction with insect cells, particularly for transfection of Spodoptera frugiperda cells.                [0224] Plant cell cultures can also be utilized as hosts. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,959,177, 6,040,498, 6,420,548, 7,125,978, and 6,417,429 (describing PLANTIBODIES.TM. technology for producing antibodies in transgenic plants).                [0225] Vertebrate cells may also be used as hosts. For example, mammalian cell lines that are adapted to grow in suspension may be useful. Other examples of useful mammalian host cell lines are monkey kidney CV1 line transformed by SV40 (COS-7); human embryonic kidney line (293 or 293 cells as described, e.g., in Graham et al., J. Gen Virol. 36:59 (1977)); baby hamster kidney cells (BHK); mouse sertoli cells (TM4 cells as described, e.g., in Mather, Biol. Reprod. 23:243-251 (1980)); monkey kidney cells (CV1); African green monkey kidney cells (VERO-76); human cervical carcinoma cells (HELA); canine kidney cells (MDCK; buffalo rat liver cells (BRL 3A); human lung cells (W138); human liver cells (Hep G2); mouse mammary tumor (MMT 060562); TR1 cells, as described, e.g., in Mather et al., Annals N.Y. Acad. Sci. 383:44-68 (1982); MRC 5 cells; and FS4 cells. Other useful mammalian host cell lines include Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, including DHFR.sup.- CHO cells (Urlaub et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77:4216 (1980)); and myeloma cell lines such as YO, NSO and Sp2/0. For a review of certain mammalian host cell lines suitable for antibody production, see, e.g., Yazaki and Wu, Methods in Molecular Biology, Vol. 248 (B.K.C. Lo, ed., Humana Press, Totowa, N.J.), pp. 255-268 (2003).                [0226] C. Assays                [0227] Anti-PCSK9 antibodies provided herein may be identified, screened for, or characterized for their physical/chemical properties and/or biological activities by various assays known in the art.                [0228] 1. Binding Assays and Other Assays                [0229] In one aspect, an anti-PCSK9 antibody of the invention is tested for its PCSK9 binding activity, e.g., by known methods such as ELISA, Western blot, etc. Numerous types of competitive binding assays can be used to determine if an anti-PCSK9 antibody competes with another, for example: solid phase direct or indirect radioimmunoassay (RIA), solid phase direct or indirect enzyme immunoassay (EIA), sandwich competition assay (see, e.g., Stahli et al., 1983, Methods in Enzymology 9:242-253); solid phase direct biotin-avidin EIA (see, e.g., Kirkland et al., 1986, J. Immunol. 137:3614-3619) solid phase direct labeled assay, solid phase direct labeled sandwich assay (see, e.g., Harlow and Lane, 1988, Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Press); solid phase direct label RIA using 1-125 label (see, e.g., Morel et al., 1988, Molec. Immunol. 25:7-15); solid phase direct biotin-avidin EIA (see, e.g., Cheung, et al., 1990, Virology 176:546-552); and direct labeled RIA (Moldenhauer et al., 1990, Scand. J. Immunol. 32:77-82). Typically, such an assay involves the use of purified antigen bound to a solid surface or cells bearing either of these, an unlabelled test antigen binding protein and a labeled reference antigen binding protein. Competitive inhibition is measured by determining the amount of label bound to the solid surface or cells in the presence of the test antigen binding protein. Usually the test antigen binding protein is present in excess. Antigen binding proteins identified by competition assay (competing antigen binding proteins) include antigen binding proteins binding to the same epitope as the reference antigen binding proteins and antigen binding proteins binding to an adjacent epitope sufficiently proximal to the epitope bound by the reference antigen binding protein for steric hindrance to occur. Additional details regarding methods for determining competitive binding are provided in the examples herein. Usually, when a competing antigen binding protein is present in excess, it will inhibit (e.g., reduce) specific binding of a reference antigen binding protein to a common antigen by at least 40-45%, 45-50%, 50-55%, 55-60%, 60-65%, 65-70%, 70-75% or 75% or more. In certain embodiments, binding is inhibited by at least 80-85%, 85-90%, 90-95%, 95-97%, or 97% or more.                [0230] In one aspect of the invention, competition assays may be used to identify an antibody that competes with anti-PCSK9 antibody 508.20.04, 508.20.06, 508.20.28, 508.20.33 or 508.20.84 for binding to PCSK9. In certain embodiments, such a competing antibody binds to the same epitope (e.g., a linear or a conformational epitope) that is bound by anti-PCSK9 antibody 508.20.04, 508.20.06, 508.20.28, 508.20.33 and/or 508.20.84. Detailed exemplary methods for mapping an epitope to which an antibody binds are provided in Morris (1996) \"Epitope Mapping Protocols,\" in Methods in Molecular Biology vol. 66 (Humana Press, Totowa, N.J.).                [0231] In an exemplary competition assay, immobilized PCSK9 is incubated in a solution comprising a first labeled antibody that binds to PCSK9 (e.g., anti-PCSK9 antibody 508.20.04, 508.20.06, 508.20.28, 508.20.33 or 508.20.84) and a second unlabeled antibody that is being tested for its ability to compete with the first antibody for binding to PCSK9. The second antibody may be present in a hybridoma supernatant. As a control, immobilized PCSK9 is incubated in a solution comprising the first labeled antibody but not the second unlabeled antibody. After incubation under conditions permissive for binding of the first antibody to PCSK9, excess unbound antibody is removed, and the amount of label associated with immobilized PCSK9 is measured. If the amount of label associated with immobilized PCSK9 is substantially reduced in the test sample relative to the control sample, then that indicates that the second antibody is competing with the first antibody for binding to PCSK9. See Harlow and Lane (1988) Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual ch.14 (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.).                [0232] 2. Activity Assays                [0233] In one aspect, assays are provided for identifying anti-PCSK9 antibodies thereof having biological activity. Biological activity of the anti-PCSK9 antibodies may include, e.g., blocking, antagonizing, suppressing, interfering, modulating and/or reducing one or more biological activities of PCSK9. Antibodies having such biological activity in vivo and/or in vitro are provided.                [0234] In certain embodiments, anti-PCSK9 antibody binds human PCSK9 and prevents interaction with the LDLR. In certain embodiments, anti-PCSK9 antibody binds specifically to human PCSK9 and/or substantially inhibits binding of human PCSK9 to LDLR by at least about 20%-40%, 40-60%, 60-80%, 80-85%, or more (for example, by measuring binding in an in vitro competitive binding assay). In certain embodiments, the invention provides isolated anti-PCSK9 antibodies which specifically bind to PCSK9 and which antagonize the PCSK9-mediated effect on LDLR levels when measured in vitro using the LDLR down regulation assay in HepG2 cells disclosed herein.                [0235] D. Immunoconjugates                [0236] The invention also provides immunoconjugates comprising an anti-PCSK9 antibody herein conjugated to one or more cytotoxic agents, such as chemotherapeutic agents or drugs, growth inhibitory agents, toxins (e.g., protein toxins, enzymatically active toxins of bacterial, fungal, plant, or animal origin, or fragments thereof), or radioactive isotopes.

[0239] In another embodiment, an immunoconjugate comprises an antibody as described herein conjugated to a radioactive atom to form a radioconjugate. A variety of radioactive isotopes are available for the production of radioconjugates. Examples include At.sup.211, I.sup.131, I.sup.125, Y.sup.90, Re.sup.186, Re.sup.188, Sm.sup.153, Bi.sup.212, P.sup.32, Pb.sup.212 and radioactive isotopes of Lu.

[0240] Conjugates of an antibody and cytotoxic agent may be made using a variety of bifunctional protein coupling agents such as N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio) propionate (SPDP), succinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (SMCC), iminothiolane (IT), bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters (such as dimethyl adipimidate HCl), active esters (such as disuccinimidyl suberate), aldehydes (such as glutaraldehyde), bis-azido compounds (such as bis (p-azidobenzoyl) hexanediamine), bis-diazonium derivatives (such as bis-(p-diazoniumbenzoyl)-ethylenediamine), diisocyanates (such as toluene 2,6-diisocyanate), and bis-active fluorine compounds (such as 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene). For example, a ricin immunotoxin can be prepared as described in Vitetta et al., Science 238:1098 (1987). Carbon-14-labeled 1-isothiocyanatobenzyl-3-methyldiethylene triaminepentaacetic acid (MX-DTPA) is an exemplary chelating agent for conjugation of radionucleotide to the antibody. See WO94/11026. The linker may be a \"cleavable linker\" facilitating release of a cytotoxic drug in the cell. For example, an acid-labile linker, peptidase-sensitive linker, photolabile linker, dimethyl linker or disulfide-containing linker (Chari et al., Cancer Res. 52:127-131 (1992); U.S. Pat.

[0242] E. Methods and Compositions for Diagnostics and Detection                [0243] In certain embodiments, any of the anti-PCSK9 antibodies provided herein is useful for detecting the presence of PCSK9 in a biological sample. The term \"detecting\" as used herein encompasses quantitative or qualitative detection. In certain embodiments, a biological sample is blood, serum or other liquid samples of biological origin. In certain embodiments, a biological sample comprises a cell or tissue.                [0244] In one embodiment, an anti-PCSK9 antibody for use in a method of diagnosis or detection is provided. In a further aspect, a method of detecting the presence of PCSK9 in a biological sample is provided.

In certain embodiments, the method comprises contacting the biological sample with an anti-PCSK9 antibody as described herein under conditions permissive for binding of the anti-PCSK9 antibody to PCSK9, and detecting whether a complex is formed between the anti-PCSK9 antibody and PCSK9. Such method may be an in vitro or in vivo method. In one embodiment, an anti-PCSK9 antibody is used to select subjects eligible for therapy with an anti-PCSK9 antibody, e.g. where PCSK9 or LDL-cholesterol is a biomarker for selection of patients.

No. 6,171,586 and WO2006/044908, the latter formulations including a histidine-acetate buffer.                [0251] The formulation herein may also contain more than one active ingredients as necessary for the particular indication being treated, preferably those with complementary activities that do not adversely affect each other. For example, it may be desirable to further provide statin. Such active ingredients are suitably present in combination in amounts that are effective for the purpose intended.                [0252] Active ingredients may be entrapped in microcapsules prepared, for example, by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization, for example, hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin-microcapsules and poly-(methylmethacylate) microcapsules, respectively, in colloidal drug delivery systems (for example, liposomes, albumin microspheres, microemulsions, nano-particles and nanocapsules) or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences 16th edition, Osol, A. Ed. (1980).                [0253] Sustained-release preparations may be prepared. Suitable examples of sustained-release preparations include semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the antibody, which matrices are in the form of shaped articles, e.g. films, or microcapsules.                [0254] The formulations to be used for in vivo administration are generally sterile. Sterility may be readily accomplished, e.g., by filtration through sterile filtration membranes.

In another embodiment, the medicament is for use in a method of treating hypercholesterolemia comprising administering to an individual having hypercholesterolemia an effective amount of the medicament.                [0259] In certain embodiments, the disorder treated is any disease or condition which is improved, ameliorated, inhibited or prevented by removal, inhibition or reduction of PCSK9 activity. In certain embodiments, diseases or disorders that are generally addressable (either treatable or preventable) through the use of statins can also be treated. In certain embodiments, disorders or disease that can benefit from the prevention of cholesterol synthesis or increased LDLR expression can also be treated by anti-PCSK9 antibodies of the present invention. In certain embodiments, individuals treatable by the anti-PCSK9 antibodies and therapeutic methods of the invention include individuals indicated for LDL apheresis, individuals with PCSK9-activating mutations (gain of function mutations, \"GOF\"), individuals with heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (heFH), individuals with primary hypercholesterolemia who are statin intolerant or statin uncontrolled, and individuals at risk for developing hypercholesterolemia who may be preventably treated. Other indications include dyslipidemia associated with secondary causes such as Type 2 diabetes mellitus, cholestatic liver diseases (primary biliary cirrhosis), nephrotic syndrome, hypothyroidism, obesity, and the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases.                [0260] In certain embodiments, the methods and uses described herein further comprises administering to the individual an effective amount of at least one additional therapeutic agent, e.g., statin. In certain embodiments, the additional therapeutic agent is for preventing and/or treating atherosclerosis and/or cardiovascular diseases. In certain embodiment, the additional therapeutic agent is for use in a method of reducing the risk of recurrent cardiovascular events. In certain embodiments, the additional therapeutic agent is for elevating the level of HDL-cholesterol in a subject.                [0261] In a further aspect, the invention provides pharmaceutical formulations comprising any of the anti-PCSK9 antibodies provided herein, e.g., for use in any of the above therapeutic methods. In one embodiment, a pharmaceutical formulation comprises any of the anti-PCSK9 antibodies provided herein and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In another embodiment, a pharmaceutical formulation comprises any of the anti-PCSK9 antibodies provided herein and at least one additional therapeutic agent, e.g., statin.                [0262] Antibodies of the invention can be used either alone or in combination with other agents in a therapy. For instance, an antibody of the invention may be co-administered with at least one additional therapeutic agent. In certain embodiments, such additional therapeutic agent elevates the level of LDLR. In certain embodiments, an additional therapeutic agent is a LDL-cholesterol lowering drugs such as statin, e.g., atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, mevastatin, pitavastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, simvastatin, or any combination thereof, e.g., VYTORIN.RTM., ADVICOR.RTM. or SIMCOR.RTM.. In certain embodiments, an additional therapeutic agent is a HDL-cholesterol raising drugs.                [0263] Such combination therapies noted above encompass combined administration (where two or more therapeutic agents are included in the same or separate formulations), and separate administration, in which case, administration of the anti-PC SK9 antibody of the invention can occur prior to, simultaneously, and/or following, administration of the additional therapeutic agent and/or adjuvant.                [0264] An antibody of the invention (and any additional therapeutic agent) can be administered by any suitable means, including parenteral, intrapulmonary, and intranasal, and, if desired for local treatment, intralesional administration. Parenteral infusions include intramuscular, intravenous, intraarterial, intraperitoneal, or subcutaneous administration. Dosing can be by any suitable route, e.g., by injections, such as intravenous or subcutaneous injections, depending in part on whether the administration is brief or chronic. Various dosing schedules including but not limited to single or multiple administrations over various time-points, bolus administration, and pulse infusion are contemplated herein.                [0265] Anti-PC SK9 antibodies of the invention would be formulated, dosed, and administered in a fashion consistent with good medical practice. Factors for consideration in this context include the particular disorder being treated, the particular mammal being treated, the clinical condition of the individual patient, the cause of the disorder, the site of delivery of the agent, the method of administration, the scheduling of administration, and other factors known to medical practitioners. The antibody need not be, but is optionally formulated with one or more agents currently used to prevent or treat the disorder in question. The effective amount of such other agents depends on the amount of antibody present in the formulation, the type of disorder or treatment, and other factors discussed above. These are generally used in the same dosages and with administration routes as described herein, or about from 1 to 99% of the dosages described herein, or in any dosage and by any route that is empirically/clinically determined to be appropriate.                [0266] For the prevention or treatment of disease, the appropriate dosage of an antibody of the invention (when used alone or in combination with one or more other additional therapeutic agents) will depend on the type of disease to be treated, the type of antibody, the severity and course of the disease, whether the antibody is administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes, previous therapy, the patient's clinical history and response to the antibody, and the discretion of the attending physician. The antibody is suitably administered to the patient at one time or over a series of treatments. Depending on the type and severity of the disease, about 1 .mu.g/kg to 15 mg/kg (e.g. 0.1 mg/kg-10 mg/kg) of antibody can be an initial candidate dosage for administration to the patient, whether, for example, by one or more separate administrations, or by continuous infusion. One typical daily dosage might range from about 1 .mu.g/kg to 100 mg/kg or more, depending on the factors mentioned above. For repeated administrations over several days or longer, depending on the condition, the treatment would generally be sustained until a desired suppression of disease symptoms occurs. One exemplary dosage of the antibody would be in the range from about 0.05 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg. Thus, one or more doses of about 0.5 mg/kg, 2.0 mg/kg, 4.0 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg (or any combination thereof) may be administered to the patient. Such doses may be administered intermittently, e.g. every week or every three weeks (e.g. such that the patient receives from about two to about twenty, or e.g. about six doses of the antibody). An initial higher loading dose, followed by one or more lower doses may be administered.                [0267] In certain embodiments, a flat-fixed dosing regimen is used to administer anti-PCSK9 antibody to an individual. Depending on the type and severity of the disease an exemplary flat-fixed dosage might range from 10 to 1000 mg of anti-PCSK9 antibody. One exemplary dosage of the antibody would be in the range from about 10 mg to about 600 mg. Another exemplary dosage of the antibody would be in the range from about 100 mg to about 600 mg. In certain embodiments, 150 mg, 300 mg, or 600 mg of anti-PCSK9 antibody is administered to an individual. However, other dosage regimens may be useful. The progress of this therapy is easily monitored by conventional techniques and assays.                [0268] It is understood that any of the above formulations or therapeutic methods may be carried out using an immunoconjugate of the invention in place of or in addition to an anti-PCSK9 antibody.                [0269] H.

[0272] It is understood that any of the above articles of manufacture may include an immunoconjugate of the invention in place of or in addition to an anti-PCSK9 antibody.                III. EXAMPLES                [0273] The following are examples of methods and compositions of the invention. It is understood that various other embodiments may be practiced, given the general description provided above.                Example 1                Generation of Anti-PCSK9 Antibodies                [0274] Residue numbers are according to Kabat (Kabat et al., Sequences of proteins of immunological interest, 5th Ed., Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1991)).                [0275] Library Sorting and Screening to Identify Anti-PCSK9 Antibodies                [0276] Biotinylated human PCSK9 generated in-house was used as antigen for library sorting.                [0277] The phage libraries were sorted five rounds against biotinylated PCSK9 in solution phase. For the first round of sorting, 20 .mu.g/mL biotinylated PCSK9 was added to antibody phage libraries VH (see, e.g., Lee et al., J. Immunol. Meth. 284:119-132, 2004) and VH/VL (see Liang et al., JMB. 366: 815-829, 2007) pre-blocked with phage blocking buffer PBST (phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20) and incubated overnight at room temperature. The following day 120 .mu.l of PBST/BSA pre-absorbed DYNABEADS.RTM. MyOne.TM. Streptavidin T1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) was added to each library and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. The beads were then washed three times with PBT (PBS with 0.05% Tween 20), and bound phage were eluted with 1 mL 50 mM HCl and 500 mM NaCl for 30 minutes and neutralized with 4004 of 1 M Tris base (pH7.5). Recovered phages were amplified in E. coli XL-1 Blue cells. During the subsequent selection rounds, incubation of antibody phage with the biotinylated PCSK9 was reduced to 2-3 hours, and the phage bound antigen was captured for 30 minutes on neutravidin-coated (Catalog #89890, 10 .mu.g/ml, Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Mass.) or streptavidin-coated (Catalog #21125, 10 .mu.g/ml, Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Mass.) Nunc 96 well Maxisorp immunoplates. The stringency of plate washing was gradually increased.                [0278] After 5 rounds of panning, significant enrichment was observed. 96 clones were picked each from VH and VH/VL library sorting to determine whether they specifically bound to human PCSK9. The variable regions of these clones were PCR sequenced to identify unique sequence clones. Unique phage antibodies that bind human PCSK9 at least 5.times. above background were chosen and reformatted to full length IgGs for evaluation in in vitro cell assay.                [0279] Clones of interest were reformatted into IgGs by cloning VL and VH regions of individual clones into the LPG3 and LPG4 vector respectively, transiently expressing in mammalian CHO cells, and purifying with a protein A column.                [0280] Construct Libraries for Affinity Improvement of Clones Derived from the VH Library                [0281] Phagemid pWO703 (derived from phagemid pV0350-2b (Lee et al., J. Mol. Biol. 340, 1073-1093 (2004)), containing stop codon (TAA) in all CDR-L3 positions and displaying monovalent Fab on the surface of M13 bacteriophage served as the library template for grafting heavy chain variable domains (VH) of clones of interest from the VH library for affinity maturation. Both hard and soft randomization strategies were used for affinity maturation. For hard randomization, one light chain library with selected positions of the three light chain CDRs was randomized using amino acids designed to mimic natural human antibodies and the designed DNA degeneracy was as described in Lee et al. (J. Mol. Biol. 340, 1073-1093 (2004)). For soft randomization, residues at positions 91-96 of CDR-L3, 30-33, 35 of CDR-H1, 50, 52, 53-54, 56, and 58 of CDR-H2, 95-100, 100A, and 100C of CDR-H3, were targeted; and three different combinations of CDR loops, H1/L3, H2/L3, and H3/L3, were selected for randomization. To achieve the soft randomization conditions, which introduced the mutation rate of approximately 50% at the selected positions, the mutagenic DNA was synthesized with 70-10-10-10 mixtures of bases favoring the wild type nucleotides (Gallop et al., Journal of Medicinal Chemistry 37:1233-1251 (1994)).                [0282] Phage Sorting Strategy to Generate Affinity Improvement                [0283] For affinity improvement selection, phage libraries were subjected to five rounds of solution sorting with increasing stringency. For the first round of solution sorting, 3 O.D./ml in 1% BSA and 0.05% Tween 20 of phage input were incubated with 100 nM biotinylated PCSK9 (the concentration is based on parental clone phage IC50 value) in 100 .mu.l buffer containing 1% Superblock (Pierce Biotechnology) and 0.05% Tween 20 for 2 hours at room temperature. The mixture was further diluted 10.times. with 1% Superblock, and 100 .mu.l/well was applied to neutravidin-coated wells (10 m/ml) for 30 minutes at room temperature with gentle shaking. The wells were washed with PBS-0.05% Tween 20 ten times. To determine background binding, control wells containing phage were captured on neutravidin-coated plates. Bound phage was eluted with 150 .mu.l/well 50 mM HCl, 500 mM KCl for 30 minutes, and subsequently neutralized by 50 .mu.l/well of 1M Tris pH8, titered, and propagated for the next round. Four more rounds of solution sorting were carried out together with increasing selection stringency. The first couple of rounds were for on-rate selection by decreasing biotinylated target protein concentration from 100 nM to 1 nM, and the last two rounds were for off-rate selection by adding excess amounts of non-biotinylated target protein (300 to 1000 fold more) to compete off weaker binders at room temperature.                [0284] High Throughput Affinity Screening ELISA (Single Spot Competition)                [0285] Colonies were picked from the fifth round of screening. Colonies were grown overnight at 37.degree. C. in 150 .mu.l/well of 2YT media with 50 m/ml carbenicillin and 1E10/ml KO7 in 96-well plate (Falcon). From the same plate, a colony of XL-1 infected parental phage was picked as control. 96-well Nunc Maxisorp plates were coated with 100 .mu.l/well of neutravidin (10 m/ml) in PBS at 4.degree. C. overnight. The plates were blocked with 150 .mu.l of 1% BSA and 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS for 1 hour.                [0286] 35 .mu.l of the phage supernatant was diluted with 35 .mu.l of ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay) buffer (PBS with 0.5% BSA, 0.05% Tween 20) with or without 15 nM PCSK9 and let incubate for 1 hour at room temperature in an F plate (NUNC). 35 .mu.l of 3 .mu.g/ml biotinylated-PCSK9 was then added to each well and incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature. 95 .mu.l of mixture was transferred side by side to the neutravidin coated plates. The plate was gently shaken for 15 min to allow the capture of biotinylated-PCSK9 bound phage to the plate. The plate was washed ten times with PBS-0.05% Tween 20. The binding was quantified by adding horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-M13 antibody in ELISA buffer (1:2500) and incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature. The plates were washed with PBS-0.05% Tween 20 ten times. Next, 100 .mu.l/well of a 1:1 ratio of 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) Peroxidase substrate and Peroxidase Solution B (H.sub.2O.sub.2) (Kirkegaard-Perry Laboratories (Gaithersburg, Md.)) was added to the well and incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by adding 100 .mu.l 10.1M Phosphoric Acid (H.sub.3PO.sub.4) to each well and allowed to incubate for 5 minutes at room temperature. The O.D. (optical density) of the yellow color in each well was determined using a standard ELISA plate reader at 450 nm. The O.D. reduction (%) was calculated by the following equation:                OD.sub.450nmreduction(%)=[(OD.sub.450nm of wells with competitor)/(OD.sub.450nm of well with no competitor)]*100                [0287] In comparison to the OD.sub.450nm reduction (%) of the well of parental phage (100%), clones that had the OD.sub.450nm reduction (%) lower than 50% were picked for sequence analysis. Unique clones were selected for phage preparation to determine binding affinity (phage IC.sub.50) against PCSK9 by comparison to parental clone. Then the most affinity-improved clones were reformatted into human IgG.sub.1 for antibody production and further BIAcore binding kinetic analysis and other in vitro or in vivo assay. See FIGS. 1 and 2.                Example 2                Characterization of Anti-PCSK9 Antibodies by BIAcore                [0288] Binding affinities of anti-PCSK9 antibodies were measured by Surface Plasmon Resonance (SRP) using a BIAcore.TM.-3000 instrument. Anti-PCSK9 human antibodies were captured by mouse anti-human Fc antibody (Catalog #BR-1008-39, GE Healthcare, Piscataway, N.J.) coated on CM5 biosensor chips to achieve approximately 200 response units (RU). For kinetics measurements, two-fold serial dilutions (500 nM to 0.245 nM) of human, murine, rhesus, and cyno PCSK9 (Genentech, South San Francisco, Calif.) were injected in PBT buffer (PBS with 0.05% Tween 20) at 25.degree. C. with a flow rate of 30 .mu.l/min. Association rates (k.sub.on) and dissociation rates (k.sub.off) were calculated using a simple one-to-one Langmuir binding model (BIAcore Evaluation Software version 3.2). The equilibrium dissociation constant (K.sub.D) was calculated as the ratio k.sub.off/k.sub.on. See FIG. 3.                Example 3                LDLR-PCSK9 Binding Assay                [0289] A competition binding ELISA was performed to investigate the activity of anti-PCSK9 antibodies in blocking human PCSK9 binding to LDLR. Briefly, 1 .mu.g/mL of soluble human LDLR extracellular domain (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn.) was coated on 384-well MaxiSorp plate (NALGENE.RTM. NUNC.TM. International, Rochester, N.Y.) at 4.degree. C. overnight. Then 0.25 .mu.g/mL of biotinylated human PCSK9 pre-mixed with different concentrations of anti-PCSK9 antibodies and control antibodies were added to the plate and incubated for 2 hour at room temperature. The binding of PCSK9 to coated LDLR was detected by adding streptavidin-HRP (GE Healthcare) and substrate 3,3',5,5'-tetramethyl benzidine (TMBE-1000, Moss, Inc., Pasadena, Md.). The binding results (OD) were plotted against antibody concentration and IC.sub.50 values were generated using KaleidaGraph software. See FIG. 4.                Example 4                Antibodies Prevent LDLR Downregulation on HepG2 Cells                [0290] HepG2 cells were seeded at 1.times.10.sup.5 into a 48-well plate. The next day, the media was changed to 10% lipoprotein deficient serum (LPDS, Frederick, Md.). The following day, 15 .mu.g/mlPCSK9 plus/minus anti-PCSK9 antibody were added to cells for 4 hours at 37.degree. C. Cells were rinsed with PBS and detached using 2.5 mM EDTA. Cells were incubated with 1:20 anti-LDLR (Progen Biotechnik, Heidelberg, Germany) for 15 minutes, washed with PBS and incubated with 1:200 goat anti-mouse AlexaFluor 488 from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, Calif.) for 15 minutes. Cells were washed and resuspended in PBS plus 10 .mu.g/ml propidium iodide. The samples were then analyzed with a dual laser flow cytometer (FACScan, Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, N.J.). The data suggest all of the anti-PCSK9 antibodies described herein prevent downregulation of LDLR. See FIG. 5.                Example 5                LDLR Downregulation in Mouse Liver                [0291] Normal C57/BL6 mice (Charles River, Wilmington, Mass.) were treated with 3, 30 or 60 .mu.g of PCSK9 by I.V. administration. Using the ProteoExtract Native Membrane Protein Extraction Kit from Calbiochem (Gibbstown, N.J.) according to the manufacturer's instructions, liver from each mouse was harvested 15 min, 1 hr or 4 hrs after PCSK9 I.V. administration and proteins extracted. As a control, 5 mice were treated with vehicle only and 8 .mu.g of each liver lysate were pooled for analysis. Lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 8% tris-gly gel (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane using iBlot (Invitrogen). The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat milk for 1 hour and then incubated with 1:500 anti-LDLR (Abcam, Cambridge, Mass.) in 5% nonfat milk overnight at 4.degree. C. The next day, the membrane was washed three times with TBS-T, incubated with 1:5000 anti-rabbit HRP (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, N.J.) for 1 hour and washed with TBS-T three times. Proteins were visualized using ECL-Plus (GE Healthcare) and exposed to XAR film (Kodak, Rochester, N.Y.). After an overnight exposure, the membrane was washed with TBS-T, incubated with 1:500 anti-transferrin receptor antibody (Invitrogen) for 1 hour, washed with TBS-T, incubated with 1:5000 anti-mouse HRP (GE Healthcare) for 1 hour, washed with TBS-T and visualized with ECL-Plus. Western blot with anti-LDLR antibody shows that 30 .mu.g of PCSK9 for 1 hour significantly downregulated LDLR levels in mouse liver. See FIG. 6.                Example 6                Antibodies Prevent Liver LDLR Downregulation                [0292] Normal C57/BL6 (Charles River) mice were injected with vehicle or 5 mg/kg anti-PCSK9 antibodies 24 hours prior to treatment with 30 .mu.g PCSK9 for 1 hour. Liver from each mouse was harvested using the ProteoExtract Native Membrane Protein Extraction Kit (Calbiochem) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 8% bis-tris gel. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane using iBlot (Invitrogen). The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat milk for 1 hour and then incubated with 1:500 anti-LDLR (Abcam) in 5% nonfat milk overnight at 4.degree. C. The next day, the membrane was washed three times with TBS-T, incubated with 1:5000 anti-rabbit HRP (GE Healthcare) for 1 hour and washed three times with TBS-T. Proteins were visualized using ECL-Plus (GE Healthcare) and exposed to XAR film (Kodak). Western blot with anti-LDLR antibody show that all five anti-PCSK9 antibodies (508.20.84, 508.20.33, 508.20.04, 508.20.28, 508.20.06) prevented LDLR downregulation in mouse liver. See FIG. 7.                Example 7                Pharmacokinetics of Anti-PCSK9 Antibody                [0293] Anti-PCSK9 antibody concentrations in mouse PK study samples were determined using anti-human IgG Fc ELISA. Briefly, donkey anti-human IgG Fc (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, Pa.) was used to coat assay plates and goat anti-human IgG Fc HRP conjugate (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, Pa.) was used as detection antibody. The assay was able to measure anti-PCSK9 antibody in up to 10% mouse serum matrix with assay range of 0.31-20 ng/mL. See FIGS. 8 and 9.                [0294] Serum anti-PCSK9 antibody concentrations in cynomolgus monkey PK study samples were determined by anti-PCSK9 antibody ELISA using recombinant human PCSK9 (Genentech, Inc. South San Francisco, Calif.) as capture and goat anti-human IgG (H+ L) HRP as detection antibody. The assay was able to measure anti-PCSK9 antibody in up to 2% cynomolgus monkey serum matrix with assay range of 0.313-50 ng/mL. See FIGS. 10 and 11.                Example 8                Antibodies Reduce Serum Cholesterol Level in Mice                [0295] Eight weeks old male C57BL/6J mice were purchased commercially from Jackson Laboratory. The mice were on housing for one week at the holding room before the start of the experiment. All mice were pre-bled under anesthesia and total cholesterol levels from the mice were determined using INFINITY.TM. Cholesterol Reagent (Fisher Diagnostics, Middletown, Va.). The mice were randomized into 6 different groups with the same level of average cholesterol level. All mice received a single dose of 10 mg/kg body weight of either control antibody or anti-PCSK9 antibodies. The mice were bled on day 3, day 7, day 10 and day 15 and serum total cholesterol levels were determined using INFINITY.TM. Cholesterol Reagent (Fisher Diagnostics, Middletown, Va.).                [0296] All five anti-PCSK9 antibodies (508.20.04, 508.20.06, 508.20.28, 508.20.33, 508.20.84) showed a reduction in total cholesterol levels when a single dose of 10 mg/kg was administered. The administration of anti-PCSK9 antibody resulted in a significant reduction in total cholesterol level on day 3 and up to day 10 when compared to the mice receiving control antibody. See FIG. 12.                Example 9                Enhancement of Statin Effectiveness                [0297] This experiment demonstrates that a combination of anti-PCSK9 antibody and statin results in a greater reduction in total cholesterol level compared to anti-PCSK9 antibody alone or statin alone treatments. See e.g., FIG. 13. Eight weeks old male C57BL/6J mice was purchased from Jackson Laboratory. The mice were grouped into 2 different groups. The non-statin mice received control diet, while statin groups received 0.2% of lovastatin in the diet for 2 weeks prior to antibody administration (Bioserve, Frenchtown, N.J.). All the mice were pre-bled and mice were randomized based on equal average cholesterol level. Mice were bled on day 3 and the total cholesterol levels were assayed using INFINITY.TM. Cholesterol Reagent (Fisher Diagnostics, Middletown, Va.).                [0298] The anti-PCSK9 antibodies showed significant cholesterol lowering effect. Statin alone treatment resulted in modest reduction in total cholesterol level, compared to non-statin groups. The combination of statin plus anti-PCSK9 antibody resulted in an additional reduction compared to anti-PCSK9 alone in total cholesterol level. See FIG. 13.                Example 10                X-Ray Crystal Structure of PCSK9 Bound to Fab Fragment of Anti-PCSK9 Antibody                [0299] Protein Purification and Crystallization                [0300] 210 g of frozen cell paste from 10 L E. coli expression were thawed in 1 L of lysis buffer (PBS/25 mM EDTA/1 mM PMSF). Cells were disrupted by Tissuemizer (30 seconds) and the resulting slurry was passed through a microfluidizer twice. Insoluble matter was pelleted by centrifugation. Clarified lysate (250 mL at a time) was loaded onto a Protein G column (cat#17-0618-05, GE Healthcare) at 5 mL/min. The column was then washed with 100 mL of lysis buffer before eluting the bound Fab fragment of anti-PCSK9 antibody with 150 mL of elution buffer (0.58% acetic acid). 25 mL fractions were collected during elution. Fractions containing Fab fragment of anti-PCSK9 antibody were pooled after SDS PAGE analysis.                [0301] 5 mL prepacked SPHP column (GE Healthcare, cat#17-1152-01) were equilibrated with 50 ml of Buffer A (20 mM MES pH5.5). Pooled fractions from the prior step were loaded onto the column at 3 mL/min. The column was washed with Buffer A to baseline. Bound Fab fragment was eluted with buffer B (20 mM MES pH 5.5, 1M NaCl) using a gradient from 0% to 100% buffer B in 20 column volumes. 2 mL fractions were collected during elution. The fractions containing the protein (determined using SDS-PAGE) were pooled and concentrated to 5 mL before loaded onto a 320 mL S75 gel filtration column that had been pre-equilibrated with sizing buffer (20 mM Hepes 7.2, 150 mM NaCl). The sizing buffer was run continuously at 1.5 mL/min for 220 mins while collecting 2 mL fractions. The peak fractions (A280) were analyzed using SDS-PAGE.                [0302] Human PCSK9 (Genbank EF692496) complementary deoxyribonucleic acids (cDNAs) containing a histidine (His).sub.8 C-terminal tag (SEQ ID NO:32) were inserted into a mammalian expression vector (pRKS) with a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter using standard molecular biology techniques. Protein was expressed by transient transfection of Chinese hamster ovary                [0303] (CHO) cells and purified from conditioned media using affinity chromatography on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic-agarose column (Qiagen) followed by gel filtration on a Sephacryl S-200 column (GE Healthcare). The correct masses of purified proteins were verified by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and the accuracy of amino acid sequences were confirmed by N-terminal sequencing.                [0304] The purified Fab fragment of anti-PCSK9 antibody and 6.9 mg of PCSK9 protein were mixed in 2-fold molar excess of the Fab fragment and incubated at 4.degree. C. for 1 hour before concentration to 5 mL. The concentrated mixture was then loaded onto a Superdex 200 size exclusion column (cat#17-1071-01, GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with sizing buffer. The sizing buffer was continuously run at 1.5 mL/min for 220 mins while collecting 2 mL fractions. The peak fractions (A280) containing both PCSK9 and Fab fragment of anti-PCSK9 antibody (SDS-PAGE) were pooled and concentrated to 20 mg/mL. The concentrated complex was then used to set up crystallization trials. Initial crystals were formed from a 1:1 mixture between protein and reservoir containing 1.3 M potassium/sodium phosphate at pH 7 using sitting drops. Crysals were optimized by varying the protein:reservoir ratio in hanging drops. A selected crystal was treated with mother liquor supplumented with 25% glycerol and preserved in liquid nitrogen.                [0305] Structure Determination of the PCSK9:Fab Fragment of Anti-PCSK9 Antibody Complex                [0306] Diffraction data extending to about 3.5 .ANG. resolution were collected at synchrotron beamline SSRL 7-1 and integrated and scaled in space group 1222. Approximate phases were obtained by the method of molecular replacement, using the previously reported structure of PCSK9 (Hampton et al., PNAS104:14609-9 (2007), pdb accession code 2QTW) and the previously reported structure of an antibody Fv fragment (Eigenbrot et al., J Mol Biol 229:969-95 (1993), pdb accession code 1FVC). The constant region of Fab fragment of anti-PCSK9 antibody was placed as a rigid body using a part of a previously reported homologous structure (Eigenbrot et al. supra, pdb accession code 1FVD) after partial refinement had improved phases. The final refined structure has crystallographic R-values of 25 & 30%. Data collection and refinement statistics appear in Table 1 below.

[0307] Determination of Epitope on PCSK9 from the X-Ray Structure                [0308] A 4A criterion was applied using the molecular analysis program PyMOL. PCSK9 residues within 4A of any part of the Fab fragment of anti-PCSK9 antibody were determined as an epitope. Based on the analysis, the epitope comprises one or more of the following residues: R194, E195, D238, A239, A341, Q342, E366, D367, I369, S376, T377, C378, F379, S381 and H391 of human PCSK9.

        "description": "STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY-SPONSORED R&D        Not Applicable.                REFERENCE TO MICROFICHE APPENDIX                Not Applicable.                BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION                Proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (hereinafter called \"PCSK9\"), also known as neural apoptosis-regulated convertase 1 (\"NARC-1\"), is a proteinase K-like subtilase identified as the 9.sup.th member of the secretory subtilase family; see Seidah et al., 2003 PNAS 100:928-933. The gene for PCSK9 localizes to human chromosome 1p33-p34.3; Seidah et al., supra. PCSK9 is expressed in cells capable of proliferation and differentiation including, for example, hepatocytes, kidney mesenchymal cells, intestinal ileum, and colon epithelia as well as embryonic brain telencephalon neurons; Seidah et al., supra.                Original synthesis of PCSK9 is in the form of an inactive enzyme precursor, or zymogen, of .about.72-kDa which undergoes autocatalytic, intramolecular processing in the endoplasmic reticulum (\"ER\") to activate its functionality. This internal processing event has been reported to occur at the SSVFAQ.dwnarw.SIPWNL.sup.158 motif (SEQ ID NOs: 19 and 20, respectively); Benjannet et al., 2004 J. Biol. Chem. 279:48865-48875. Such internal processing has been reported as a requirement of exit from the ER; Benjannet et al., supra; Seidah et al., supra. The cleaved and, thereby, activated protein is secreted in association with the cleaved peptide; supra.                The sequence for human PCSK9 (.about.22-kb long with 12 exons encoding a 692 amino acid protein) can be found in one instance at Deposit No. NP.sub.--777596.2. Human, mouse and rat PCSK9 nucleic acid sequences have been deposited; see, e.g., GenBank Accession Nos.: AX127530 (also AX207686), NP.sub.--705793 (also Q80W65), and P59996, respectively. PCSK9 possesses several domains found in other proprotein convertases, including an N-terminal signal sequence, a pro domain, a catalytic domain and a cysteine-rich C terminal domain. The PCSK9 catalytic domain shares high sequence similarity with the proteinase K family of subtilases and, notably, a catalytic triad of D186, H226 and S386.                PCSK9 is disclosed and/or claimed in several patent publications including, but not limited to the following: PCT Publication Nos. WO 01/31007, WO 01/57081, WO 02/14358, WO 01/98468, WO 02/102993, WO 02/102994, WO 02/46383, WO 02/90526, WO 01/77137, and WO 01/34768; US Publication Nos. US 2004/0009553 and US 2003/0119038, and European Publication Nos. EP 1 440 981, EP 1 067 182, and EP 1 471 152.                PCSK9 has been ascribed a role in the differentiation of hepatic and neuronal cells (Seidah et al., supra.), is highly expressed in embryonic liver, and has been strongly implicated in cholesterol homeostasis. Studies have suggested a specific role for PCSK9 in cholesterol biosynthesis or uptake. In a study of cholesterol-fed rats, Maxwell et al. found that PCSK9 was downregulated in a similar manner to three other genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis, Maxwell et al., 2003 J. Lipid Res. 44:2109-2119. The expression of PCSK9 has, in fact, been shown to be regulated by sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (\"SREBP\"), as seen with other genes involved in cholesterol metabolism; supra. Later support for these findings came about through a study of PCSK9 transcriptional regulation which demonstrated that such regulation was quite typical of other genes implicated in lipoprotein metabolism; Dubuc et al., 2004 Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 24:1454-1459. Statins have been shown to upregulate PCSK9 expression in a manner attributed to the cholesterol-lowering effects of the drugs; supra. Moreover, it has been shown that PCSK9 promoters possess two conserved sites involved in cholesterol regulation, a sterol regulatory element and an Sp1 site; supra.                Several lines of evidence demonstrate that PCSK9, in particular, lowers the amount of hepatic LDLR protein and thus compromises the liver's ability to remove LDL cholesterol from the circulation. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of PCSK9 in the livers of mice results in the accumulation of circulating LDL-C due to a dramatic loss of hepatic LDLR protein, with no effect on LDLR mRNA levels; Benjannet et al., 2004 J. Biol. Chem. 279:48865-48875; Maxwell & Breslow, 2004 PNAS 101:7100-7105; Park et al., 2004 J. Biol. Chem. 279:50630-50638; and Lalanne et al., 2005 J. Lipid Res. 46:1312-1319. The effect of PCSK9 overexpression on raising circulating LDL-C levels in mice is completely dependent on the expression of LDLR, again, indicating that the regulation of LDL-C by PCSK9 is mediated through downregulation of LDLR protein. In agreement with these findings, mice lacking PCSK9 or in which PCSK9 mRNA has been lowered by antisense oligonucleotide inhibitors have higher levels of hepatic LDLR protein and a greater ability to clear circulating LDL-C; Rashid et al., 2005 PNAS 102:5374-5379; and Graham et al., 2007 J. Lipid Res. 48(4):763-767. In addition, lowering PCSK9 levels in cultured human hepatocytes by siRNA also results in higher LDLR protein levels and an increased ability to take up LDL-C; Benjannet et al., 2004 J. Biol. Chem. 279:48865-48875; and Lalanne et al., 2005 J. Lipid Res. 46:1312-1319. Together, these data indicate that PCSK9 action leads to increased LDL-C by lowering LDLR protein levels.                A number of mutations in the gene PCSK9 have also been conclusively associated with autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia (\"ADH\"), an inherited metabolism disorder characterized by marked elevations of low density lipoprotein (\"LDL\") particles in the plasma which can lead to premature cardiovascular failure; see Abifadel et al., 2003 Nature Genetics 34:154-156; Timms et al., 2004 Hum. Genet. 114:349-353; Leren, 2004 Clin. Genet. 65:419-422. A later-published study on the S127R mutation of Abifadel et al., supra, reported that patients carrying such a mutation exhibited higher total cholesterol and apoB100 in the plasma attributed to (1) an overproduction of apoB100-containing lipoproteins, such as low density lipoprotein (\"LDL\"), very low density lipoprotein (\"VLDL\") and intermediate density lipoprotein (\"IDL\"), and (2) an associated reduction in clearance or conversion of said lipoproteins; Ouguerram et al., 2004 Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 24:1448-1453.                Accordingly, there can be no doubt that PCSK9 plays a role in the regulation of LDL. The expression or upregulation of PCSK9 is associated with increased plasma levels of LDL cholesterol, and the corresponding inhibition or lack of expression of PCSK9 is associated with reduced LDL cholesterol plasma levels. Decreased levels of LDL cholesterol associated with sequence variations in PCSK9 have been found to confer protection against coronary heart disease; Cohen, 2006 N. Engl. J. Med. 354:1264-1272.                The identification of compounds and/or agents effective in the treatment of cardiovascular affliction is highly desirable. In clinical trials, reductions in LDL cholesterol levels have been directly related to the rate of coronary events; Law et al., 2003 BMJ 326:1423-1427. More recently, the moderate lifelong reduction in plasma LDL cholesterol levels was found to correlate with a substantial reduction in the incidence of coronary events; Cohen et al., supra. This was the case even in populations with a high prevalence of non-lipid-related cardiovascular risk factors; supra. Accordingly, there is great benefit to be reaped from the managed control of LDL cholesterol levels.                The present invention advances these interests by providing antagonists of PCSK9 of use for inhibiting the activities of PCSK9 and the corresponding role PCSK9 plays in various therapeutic conditions.                SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION                The present invention relates to antagonists of PCSK9 and, in particular embodiments, those antagonists that inhibit both human and murine PCSK9 and those exhibiting preferential targeting of processed PCSK9. Broadly, protein-specific antagonists of PCSK9 (or \"PCSK9-specific antagonists\" as referred to herein) are PCSK9 protein binding molecules or molecules effective in the selective binding of PCSK9 and inhibition of PCSK9 function. These molecules are of import in the treatment of conditions associated with or impacted by PCSK9 function, including, but not limited to hypercholesterolemia, coronary heart disease, metabolic syndrome, acute coronary syndrome and related conditions. PCSK9-specific antagonists are characterized by selective recognition and binding to PCSK9. PCSK9-specific antagonists do not show significant binding to proteins other than PCSK9, other than in those specific instances where the antagonist is supplemented or designed to confer an additional, distinct specificity to the PCSK9-specific binding component.                PCSK9-specific antagonists forming particular embodiments hereof comprise (a) a heavy chain variable region comprising a CDR3 domain comprising SEQ ID NO: 17 or an equivalent of SEQ ID NO: 17, said equivalent characterized as having one or more conservative amino acid substitutions in the CDR3 domain; and/or (b) a light chain variable region comprising a CDR3 domain comprising SEQ ID NO: 7 or an equivalent of SEQ ID NO: 7, said equivalent characterized as having one or more conservative amino acid substitutions in the CDR3 domain. In specific embodiments, PCSK9-specific antagonists bind to human and/or murine PCSK9 with a K.sub.D of 1.2.times.10.sup.-6 M or less. In more specific embodiments, PCSK9-specific antagonists bind to human and/or murine PCSK9 with a K.sub.D of 1.times.10.sup.-7 M or less. In additional embodiments, PCSK9-specific antagonists bind to human and/or murine PCSK9 with a K.sub.D of 1.times.10.sup.-8 M or less. In further embodiments, PCSK9-specific antagonists bind to human and/or murine PCSK9 with a K.sub.D of 5.times.10.sup.-9 M or less, or of 1.times.10.sup.-9 M or less. In select embodiments, PCSK9-specific antagonists bind to human and/or murine PCSK9 with a K.sub.D of 1.times.10.sup.-10 M or less, a K.sub.D of 1.times.10.sup.-11 M or less, or a K.sub.D of 1.times.10.sup.-12 M or less. In specific embodiments, PCSK9-specific antagonists do not bind proteins other than PCSK9 at the above levels indicated for binding to PCSK9.                Particular embodiments of the present invention include PCSK9-specific antagonists which exhibit binding to PCSK9 at one of the above prescribed levels and compete for binding to PCSK9 with 1D05 antibody molecules. 1D05 antibody molecules form important PCSK9-specific antagonists hereof. 1D05 antibody molecules are characterized as comprising a (i) heavy chain variable region (\"VH\") comprising SEQ ID NO: 11; and (ii) a light chain variable region (\"VL\") comprising SEQ ID NO: 27. Said VH and VL regions comprise the full complement of disclosed CDRs 1, 2 and 3 for the VH (SEQ ID NOs: 13, 15 and 17) and VL regions (SEQ ID NOs: 3, 5 and 7), respectively. Examples of 1D05 antibody molecules include without limitation: (i) a Fab which comprises a light chain comprising SEQ ID NO: 1 and an Fd chain comprising amino acids 1-233 of SEQ ID NO: 9 (or SEQ ID NO: 9); and (ii) a full length antibody molecule which comprises a light chain comprising SEQ ID NO: 26 and a heavy chain comprising SEQ ID NO: 25.                PCSK9-specific antagonists are effective in counteracting PCSK9-dependent inhibition of cellular LDL-uptake, and particularly human and/or murine PCSK9-dependent inhibition of cellular LDL uptake. Repeatedly, PCSK9-specific antagonist 1D05 has demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition of the effects of PCSK9 on LDL uptake. Accordingly, the disclosed PCSK9-specific antagonists are of import for lowering plasma LDL cholesterol levels. The disclosed antagonists also have utility for various diagnostic purposes, including the detection and quantification of PCSK9. Select 1D05 antagonists are, in particular, useful because of their cross-reactivity with both human and murine PCSK9. This quality enables particular 1D05 antagonists to be studied pharmacologically in murine models without having to ensure that the mice express human PCSK9. In such experiments, the murine model is sufficiently representative of the native activity of the targeted protein and the antagonist's inhibition thereof.                In specific embodiments, the present invention encompasses PCSK9-specific antagonists. In particular embodiments, the present invention encompasses antibody molecules comprising disclosed heavy and/or light chain variable regions, equivalents of said regions having one or more conservative amino acid substitutions, and homologs thereof. Select embodiments comprise isolated PCSK9-specific antagonists that comprise the disclosed CDR domains or sets of the heavy and/or light chain CDR domains, and equivalents of such domains characterized as having one or more conservative amino acid substitutions.

FIG. 2 illustrates the activity of 1D05 in a PCSK9-LDLR interaction TR-FRET assay. Both the Fab and IgG of 1D05 are potent and inhibit the interaction fully. For the experiment, [AF647-PCSK9]=10 nM, [Eu-sLDLR].about.1.5 nM (.about.20000 counts at FI.sub.620 nm).                FIGS. 3A-3D illustrate (i) 1D05 (Fab)'s dose-dependent inhibition of murine PCSK9-dependent loss of cellular LDL-uptake (FIG. 3A); (ii) 1D05 (IgG)'s dose-dependent inhibition of murine PCSK9-dependent loss of cellular LDL-uptake (FIG. 3B); (iii) 1D05 (Fab)'s dose-dependent inhibition of human PCSK9-dependent loss of cellular LDL-uptake (FIG. 3C); and (iv) 1D05 (IgG)'s dose-dependent inhibition of human PSCK9-dependent loss of cellular LDL-uptake (FIG. 3D). 1D05 clearly cross-reacts with both human and mouse PCSK9. FIGS. 3A-3D have two controls: (i) a cell only control, showing the basal level of cellular LDL uptake, and (ii) a cell+PCSK9 (5 .mu.g/ml) control which shows the level of PCSK9-dependent loss of LDL-uptake. The titration experiments which contain 1D05 and PCSK9 were done at a fixed concentration of PCSK9 (5 .mu.g/ml) and increasing concentrations of 1D05 shown in the graphs. As shown, 1D05 can inhibit the effect of PCSK9 on cellular LDL uptake. IC.sub.50s for 1D05 (Fab) are 97 and 144 nM for mouse and human PCSK9 protein, respectively. IC.sub.50s for 1D05 (IgG) are 85 and 79 nM for mouse and human PCSK9 protein, respectively.                FIGS. 4A and 4B illustrate inhibition of PCSK9 internalization by 1D05 (Fab and IgG, respectively) and restoration of LDL uptake. HepG2 cells were plated and AlexaFluor-labeled PCSK9 and LDL were then added to cells and incubated at 37.degree. C. for 4 hrs. Following incubation, the amount of PCSK9 or LDL internalized by cells was determined using cofocal microscopy. Controls included the addition of cells alone (No treatment), and only AF-labeled PCSK9 in addition to 50.times. (250 .mu.g/ml) unlabeled PCSK9 (50.times. Cold Wt). In addition to 5 .mu.g/ml wild-type AF-labeled PCSK9 and 10 .mu.g/ml AF-labeled LDL, increasing amounts of either the 1D05 Fab (panel A) or IGG (panel B) were added, resulting in subsequent inhibition of PCSK9 internalization into cells and a recovery of LDL uptake. Together, these studies demonstrate that both the Fab and IgG prevent PCSK9 internalization into cells.                FIG. 5 illustrates the LDL levels for each mouse represented by a set of connected symbols; the change in LDL (postbleed-prebleed) being shown as an average for each treatment group (.DELTA. mg/dL). Treatment with PBS had no effect on LDL measurements (-4 mg/dL, 5% reduction). In contrast, serum LDL was reduced 20% with 1D05 whole IgG (-19 mg/dL) and 34% with Fab fragments of 1D05 (-24 mg/dL).                FIG. 6 illustrates a sequence comparison of the constant domains of IgG1 (SEQ ID NO: 21; Fc domain of which is represented by residues 110-130 of SEQ ID NO: 21), IgG2 (SEQ ID NO: 22, Fc domain of which is represented by residues 107-326 of SEQ ID NO: 22), IgG4 (SEQ ID NO: 23; Fc domain of which is represented by residues 107-327 of SEQ ID NO: 23) and IgG2m4 (SEQ ID NO: 24; Fc domain of which is represented by residues 107-326 of SEQ ID NO: 24) isotypes.                FIGS. 7A and 7B illustrate peptide fragments originated by limited proteolysis of a) wt-PCSK9 and b) 1D05/wt-PCSK9 complex with AspN for 5 minutes. The star in FIG. 7A highlights the peptide fragment present in the wt-PCSK9 spectrum which is not detected in the 1D05/wt-PCSK9 spectrum. The aspartic acid residue 169 is hence protected in the complex.                FIGS. 8A-8H illustrate peptide fragments originated by limited proteolysis of wt-PCSK9 (FIGS. 8A-8D) and 1D05/wt-PCSK9 complex (FIGS. 8E-8H) with GluC for 15 minutes.                FIGS. 9A-9D illustrate peptide fragments originated by limited proteolysis with Trypsin of a) wt-PCSK9 and b) 1D05/wt-PCSK9 complex for 5 minutes. FIGS. 9C-D illustrate the zoom views of the same spectra, respectively. The stars in FIGS. 9A and 9C highlight the peptide fragments present in the wt-PCSK9 spectrum which are not detected in the 1D05/wt-PCSK9 spectrum.                FIG. 10 illustrates residues of the primary sequence of the wt-PCSK9 catalytic domain involved in binding with 1D05 neutralizing Fab. The peptide fragments of wt-PCSK9 protected in limited proteolysis experiments by 1D05 binding are boxed.                FIG. 11 illustrates peptides of the wt-PCSK9 catalytic domain involved in binding with 1D05 neutralizing Fab. The peptides of wt-PCSK9 protected in limited proteolysis experiments by 1D05 binding are depicted in the segments between R194 and R199, and A168 and R165 in the zoom view of the structure of wt-PCSK9.                FIGS. 12A and 12B illustrate sequence alignment between the identified general epitope areas of human (SEQ ID NO: 39) and murine (SEQ ID NO: 41) PCSK9. A consensus sequence (SEQ ID NO: 40) is provided as the second sequence of FIG. 12A. As evident in the Figures, the residues included in the protected peptide 194-199 are conserved among the two species while the residues in peptide 165-169 are not.                FIG. 13 illustrates an analysis of 1D05 and a distinct antibody 1B20 in a PCSK9-1D05 interaction TR-FRET assay. Both Fabs are potent and inhibit the interaction fully. For this experiment, [AF647-.alpha.-V5]=10 nM, [PCSK9]=10 nM, and [Eu(8044)-1D05(IgG)].about.1.5 nM (.about.18000 counts at F1620 nm).                FIGS. 14A-D illustrates that 1B20 is a full inhibitor of PCSK9 function in the Exopolar assay.                FIG. 15 illustrates 1D05 lowering LDL-C by .about.50% in rhesus at 3 mpk. Plotted are % LDL changes in serum at the different time points tested, post a single IV dose of antibody treatment.                FIG. 16 illustrates the pharmacokinetic profile of 1D05 at the dose levels shown. Plotted are the serum drug (1D05) levels at time points tested following a single IV dose of antibody. The half-life of 1D05 is 77 hr.                DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION                The present invention relates to antagonists of PCSK9 and, in particular embodiments, those antagonists that inhibit both human and murine PCSK9 and those that preferentially target processed PCSK9. Protein-specific antagonists of PCSK9 (or \"PCSK9-specific antagonists\") in accordance herewith are effective in the selective binding to and inhibition of PCSK9 function and, thus, are of import in the treatment of conditions associated with or impacted by PCSK9 function, including, but not limited to, hypercholesterolemia, coronary heart disease, metabolic syndrome, acute coronary syndrome and related conditions. Use of the term \"antagonist\" refers to the fact that the subject molecule can antagonize the functioning of PCSK9. Use of the term \"antagonizing\" or derivatives thereof refers to the act of opposing, counteracting, inhibiting, neutralizing or curtailing one or more functions of PCSK9. Reference herein to PCSK9 function or PCSK9 activity refers to any function or activity that is driven by, requires, or is exacerbated or enhanced by PCSK9. PCSK9-specific antagonists as described herein have proven to be effective for counteracting human and/or murine PCSK9-dependent inhibition of cellular LDL-uptake.                One important embodiment hereof relates to 1D05 antibody molecules. Such 1D05 antibody molecules are characterized as comprising a (i) heavy chain variable region (\"VH\") comprising SEQ ID NO: 11; and (ii) a light chain variable region (\"VL\") comprising SEQ ID NO: 27. Said VH and VL regions comprise the full complement of disclosed CDRs 1, 2 and 3 for the VH (SEQ ID NOs: 13, 15 and 17) and VL regions (SEQ ID NOs: 3, 5 and 7), respectively. Examples of 1D05 antibody molecules include without limitation: (i) a Fab which comprises a light chain comprising SEQ ID NO: 1 and an Fd chain comprising amino acids 1-233 of SEQ ID NO: 9 (or SEQ ID NO: 9); and (ii) a full length antibody molecule which comprises a light chain comprising SEQ ID NO: 26 and a heavy chain comprising SEQ ID NO: 25. The se lect group of 1D05 antibodies demonstrate that PCSK9-specific antagonists as disclosed herein effectively inhibit both human and murine PCSK9 and may be studied pharmacologically in murine models absent the expression of human PCSK9.                The CDR definitions arrived at and disclosed herein were defined using the Morphosys software program Sequence Analysis Software (\"SAS\"). Applicants wish to note, however, that various other methods are available to delineate and define the start and end points of the CDR sequences, including but not limited to Kabat, 1991 Sequences of proteins of Immunological Interest, 5.sup.th edit., NIH Publication no. 91-3242 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services; Clothia et al., 1987 J. Mol. Biol. 196:901-917; Clothia et al., 1989 Nature 342:877-883; Lefranc, 1997 Immunol. Today, 18:509; and Chen et al., 1999 J. Mol. Biol. 293:865-881. These and other methods have been reviewed and are well within the realm of skills possessed by those in the art; see, e.g., Honegger & Pluckthun, 2001 J. Mol. Biol. 309:657-670. While the current inventors have employed the SAS software to define the CDRs, the present invention fully encompasses the different definitions around the sequences and the varying CDR delineations arrived at through use of any different analysis software or methods. Said use and resulting CDR definitions based on the presently disclosed sequences is fully within the scope of the present disclosure and anticipated herein.                PCSK9-specific molecules also have utility for various diagnostic purposes in the detection and quantification of PCSK9.                Disclosed PCSK9-specific antagonists are, furthermore, unique in that select embodiments have demonstrated a preferential recognition of processed PCSK9, the active form of PCSK9.                PCSK9-specific antagonists as disclosed herein are desirable molecules for lowering plasma LDL cholesterol levels and are of utility for any primate, mammal or vertebrate of commercial or domestic veterinary importance. PCSK9-specific antagonists are of utility as well to inhibit the activity of PCSK9 in any population of cells or tissues possessing the LDL receptor. The utility of the disclosed antagonists is directly measurable by assays readily available to the skilled artisan. Means for measuring LDL uptake are described in the literature; see, e.g., Barak & Webb, 1981 J. Cell Biol. 90:595-604, and Stephan & Yurachek, 1993 J. Lipid Res. 34:325330. In addition, means for measuring LDL cholesterol in plasma is well described in the literature; see, e.g., McNamara et al., 2006 Clinica Chimica Acta 369:158-167. The particular impact of the disclosed antagonists on cellular LDL uptake may also be measured through a method which comprises providing purified PCSK9 and labeled LDL particles to a cell sample; providing a PCSK9 antagonist to the cell sample; incubating said cell sample for a period of time sufficient to allow LDL particle uptake by the cells; quantifying the amount of label incorporated into the cell; and identifying those antagonists that result in an increase in the amount of quantified label taken up by the cells as compared with that observed when PCSK9 is administered alone. An additional method for measuring the impact of the disclosed antagonists comprises providing purified PCSK9 and labeled LDL particles to a cell sample; providing a PCSK9 antagonist to the cell sample; incubating said cell sample for a period of time sufficient to allow LDL particle uptake by the cells; isolating cells of the cell sample by removing the supernate; reducing non-specific association of labeled LDL particles (whether to the plate, the cells, or anything other than the LDL receptor); lysing the cells; quantifying the amount of label retained within the cell lysate; and identifying those antagonists that result in an increase in the amount of quantified label taken up by the cells as compared with that observed when PCSK9 is administered alone. Antagonists that result in an increase in the amount of quantified label are PCSK9 antagonists.                Any type of cell bearing the LDL receptor can be employed in the above methods including, but not limited to HEK cells, HepG2 cells, and CHO cells. LDL particles derived from any source are of use in the above-described assays. In particular assays, the LDL particles are fresh particles derived from blood. This can be accomplished by any method available to the skilled artisan including, but not limited to, the method of Havel et al., 1955 J. Clin. Invest. 34: 1345-1353. The LDL particles may be labeled with fluorescence. The labeled LDL particles may have incorporated therein visible wavelength excited fluorophore 3,3'-dioctadecylindocarbocyanine iodide (dil(3)) to form the highly fluorescent LDL derivative dil(3)-LDL. Any label which enables the skilled artisan to detect LDL in the cellular lysate may be used. An LDL analog may be used that would only become detectable (e.g., become fluorescent or fluoresce at a different wavelength, etc.) when metabolized intracellularly or, for instance, if it were to become associated with (or dissociated from) other molecules in the process of becoming internalized (e.g. a FRET assay, in which an LDL analog would become associated with a secondary fluor, or else be dissociated from a quencher). Any means available in the art for detecting internalization of labeled LDL particles can be employed. The incubation time for the LDL particles and PCSK9 with the cells is an amount of time sufficient to allow LDL particle uptake by the cells. This time may be within the range of 5 minutes to 360 minutes. The concentration of PCSK9 added to the cells may be in the range of 1 nM to 5 .mu.M and, in specific methods, be in the range of 0.1 nM to 3 .mu.M. One specific means by which the skilled artisan can determine a range of concentrations for a particular PCSK9 protein is to develop a dose response curve in the LDL-uptake assay. A concentration of PCSK9 can be selected that promotes close to maximal loss of LDL-uptake and is still in the linear range of the dose response curve. Typically, this concentration is .about.5 times the EC-50 of the protein extracted from the dose response curve. The concentrations can vary by protein.                Broadly, PCSK9-specific antagonists as defined herein selectively recognize and specifically bind to PCSK9. An antibody is typically said to specifically bind an antigen when the dissociation constant is .ltoreq.1 .mu.M, preferably .ltoreq.100 nM and most preferably .ltoreq.10 nM. Use of the terms \"selective\" or \"specific\" herein, further, refers to the fact that the disclosed antagonists do not show significant binding to proteins other than PSCK9, except in those specific instances where the antagonist is supplemented or designed to confer an additional, distinct specificity to the PCSK9-specific binding portion (as, for example, in bispecific or bifunctional molecules where the molecule is designed to bind two molecules or effect two functions, at least one of which is to specifically bind PCSK9). In specific embodiments, PCSK9-specific antagonists bind to human and/or murine PCSK9 with a K.sub.D of 1.2.times.10.sup.-6 M or less. In more specific embodiments, PCSK9-specific antagonists bind to human and/or murine PCSK9 with a K.sub.D of 5.times.10.sup.-7 M or less, of 2.times.10.sup.-7 M or less, or of 1.times.10.sup.-7 M or less. In additional embodiments, PCSK9-specific antagonists bind to human and/or murine PCSK9 with a K.sub.D of 1.times.10.sup.-8 M or less. In further embodiments, PCSK9-specific antagonists bind to human and/or murine PCSK9 with a K.sub.D of 5.times.10.sup.-9 M or less, or of 1.times.10.sup.-9 M or less. In select embodiments, PCSK9-specific antagonists bind to human and/or murine PCSK9 with a K.sub.D of 1.times.10.sup.-10 M or less, a K.sub.D of 1.times.10.sup.-11 M or less, or a K.sub.D of 1.times.10.sup.-12 M or less. In specific embodiments, PCSK9-specific antagonists do not bind proteins other than PCSK9 at the above K.sub.Ds. K.sub.D refers to the dissociation constant obtained from the ratio of K.sub.d (the dissociation rate of a particular binding molecule-target protein interaction) to K.sub.a (the association rate of the particular binding molecule-target protein interaction), or K.sub.d/K.sub.a which is expressed as a molar concentration (M). K.sub.D values can be determined using methods well established in the art. A preferred method for determining the K.sub.D of a binding molecule is by using surface plasmon resonance, for example employing a biosensor system such as a Biacore.TM. (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) system.                PCSK9-specific antagonists disclosed herein have been shown to dose-dependently inhibit human and/or murine PCSK9 dependent effects on LDL uptake. Accordingly, PCSK9-specific antagonists as disclosed herein are characterized by their ability to counteract PCSK9-dependent inhibition of LDL uptake into cells. This uptake of LDL into cells by the LDL receptor is referred to herein as \"cellular LDL uptake\". In specific embodiments, PCSK9-specific antagonists counteract or antagonize human and/or murine PCSK9-dependent inhibition of LDL uptake into cells, exhibiting an IC.sub.50 of less than 1.0.times.10.sup.-6 M, or, in order of preference, less than 1.times.10.sup.-7 M, 1.times.10.sup.-8 M, 1.times.10.sup.-9 M, 1.times.10.sup.-10 M, 1.times.10.sup.-11 M and 1.times.10.sup.-12 M. The extent of inhibition by any PCSK9-specific antagonist may be measured quantitatively in statistical comparison to a control, or via any alternative method available in the art for assessing a negative effect on, or inhibition of, PCSK9 function (i.e., any method capable of assessing antagonism of PCSK9 function). In specific embodiments, the inhibition is at least about 10% inhibition. In other embodiments, the inhibition is at least 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, or 95%.

Antibodies and the use of antigen-binding fragments is well defined and understood in the literature.

Accordingly, non-antibody-based scaffolds or antagonist molecules in accordance herewith exhibiting selectivity for PCSK9 that counteract PCSK9-dependent inhibition of cellular LDL-uptake form important embodiments of the present invention. Aptamers (nucleic acid or peptide molecules capable of selectively binding a target molecule) are one specific example. They can be selected from random sequence pools or identified from natural sources such as riboswitches. Peptide aptamers, nucleic acid aptamers (e.g., structured nucleic acid, including both DNA and RNA-based structures) and nucleic acid decoys can be effective for selectively binding and inhibiting proteins of interest; see, e.g., Hoppe-Seyler & Butz, 2000 J. Mol. Med. 78:426-430; Bock et al., 1992 Nature 355:564-566; Bunka & Stockley, 2006 Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 4:588-596; Martell et al., 2002 Molec. Ther. 6:30-34; Jayasena, 1999 Clin. Chem. 45:1628-1650; the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.                Importantly, the binding site (or epitope) for 1D05 on PCSK9 was identified through limited proteolysis and mass spectrometry (\"LP-MS\"). The limited proteolysis mass spectrometry analysis involved incubating wild-type PCSK9 (\"wt-PCSK9\") and a complex of wt-PCSK9 and 1D05 with endoproteinase enzymes of different specificity in carefully controlled conditions. Under such conditions, the endoproteases cleaved only exposed primary cleavage sites. The experiment was designed so that the binding of 1D05 to wt-hPCSK9 masked surface residues normally exposed on wt-hPCSK9 not bound to the antibody. Such masked residues provided insight into the binding domain of 1D05. Through such experiments, a novel neutralizing epitope conformational in nature and represented by peptides RYRAD (SEQ ID NO: 42) AND REIEGR (SEQ ID NO: 37) was identified. This epitope falls within PCSK9's catalytic domain and provides a novel target epitope for which to identify additional effective PCSK9 antagonists. Identification of additional PCSK9-specific antagonists binding this epitope is of significant interest given 1D05's PCSK9-neutralizing activity.                One means of identifying antagonists and particularly antibodies that bind to the identified 1D05 epitope or an overlapping epitope is through a competition or similar assay where the candidate antibody or binding molecule would have to out-compete 1D05 for the epitope. Competitive antagonists encompassed herein are molecules that inhibit (i.e., prevent or interfere with in comparison to a control) or reduce 1D05 binding by at least 50%, 60%, 70%, and 80% in order of increasing preference (even more preferably, at least 90% and, most preferably, at least 95%) at 1 .mu.M or less with 1D05 at or below its K.sub.D, and in particular those molecules that antagonize (i) PCSK9 binding to the LDL receptor, (ii) PCSK9 internalization into cells, or (iii) both PCSK9 binding to the LDL receptor and PCSK9 internalization into cells. Competition between binding members may be readily assayed in vitro for example using ELISA and/or by monitoring the interaction of the antibodies with PCSK9 in solution. The exact means for conducting the analysis is not critical. PCSK9 may be immobilized to a 96-well plate or may be placed in a homogenous solution. In specific embodiments, the ability of unlabeled candidate antibody(ies) to block the binding of labeled 1D05 can be measured using radioactive, enzyme or other labels. In the reverse assay, the ability of unlabeled antibodies to interfere with the interaction of labeled 1D05 with PCSK9 wherein said 1D05 and PCSK9 are already bound is determined. In specific embodiments, (i) PCSK9 is contacted with labeled 1D05 (an antibody molecule which comprises a VL comprising SEQ ID NO: 27 and a VH comprising SEQ ID NO: 11); (ii) PCSK9 is contacted with the candidate antibody or pool of antibodies; and (iii) antibodies capable of interrupting or preventing complexes between PCSK9 and 1D05 are identified. The readout in such an example is through measurement of bound label. 1D05 and the candidate antibody(ies) may be added in any order or at the same time. A specific assay that may be run is that of Example 13 where the activity of an antibody found to bind to the same epitope domain as 1D05 is illustrated.                Antibodies identified as 1D05 competitors in the above or other suitable assays may be tested for the ability to antagonize or neutralize (i) PCSK9 binding to the LDL receptor; and/or (ii) PCSK9 internalization into cells. These parameters may be measured through the use of assays similar to that employed or described in the current specification. In specific embodiments, the inhibition demonstrated by the competing antibody is at least about 10% inhibition. In other embodiments, the inhibition is at least 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% or 95%.                The present invention specifically encompasses PCSK9-specific antagonists and particularly monoclonal antibody molecules (and their corresponding amino acid and nucleic acid sequences) that selectively bind to the epitope identified for 1D05 or an overlapping epitope interfering with 1D05's binding to PCSK9. Critical residues for 1D05 binding that were identified on the epitope of PCSK9 are those residues corresponding to residues Arg194, Glu197 and Arg199 of human PCSK9. The narrow epitope comprising these amino acid residues is represented by SEQ ID NO: 37 and falls within the area of SEQ ID NO: 39 of human PCSK9 and SEQ ID NO: 41 of murine PCSK9. A secondary footprint of the antibody is represented by SEQ ID NO: 42. Monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind to the conformational epitope represented by SEQ ID NO: 37 and SEQ ID NO:42 or an overlapping epitope antagonize or neutralize (i) PCSK9 binding to the LDL receptor; (ii) PCSK9 internalization into cells, or (iii) both. Accordingly, monoclonal antibodies that bind to an epitope on PCSK9 which comprises and/or consists of: SEQ ID NO: 37, SEQ ID NO: 39 or SEQ ID NO: 41 form important embodiments of the present invention. Specific embodiments of the present invention relate to monoclonal antibodies that recognize the following epitopes on PCSK9: SEQ ID NO: 37 and SEQ ID NO: 42. A monoclonal antibody molecule in accordance herewith may be an intact (complete or full length) antibody, a substantially intact antibody, or a portion or fragment of an antibody comprising an antigen-binding portion, e.g., a Fab fragment, Fab' fragment or F(ab').sub.2 fragment of a murine antibody or of a chimeric antibody or of a humanized antibody or of a human antibody. Monoclonal, as used herein, refers to a homogeneous or substantially homogeneous (or pure) antibody population (i.e., at least about 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, more preferably at least about 97% or 98%, or most preferably at least 99% of the antibodies in the population are identical and would compete in an ELISA assay for the same antigen or epitope. In specific embodiments of the present invention, the present invention provides monoclonal antibodies that (i) compete for binding to PCSK9 with a 1D05 antibody molecule, reducing 1D05 binding by at least 50% at 1 .mu.M or less with 1D05 at or below its K.sub.D, (ii) block PCSK9 binding to the LDL receptor, (iii) inhibit PCSK9 internalization into the cell, and (iv) comprise a specific antigen-binding region, VH, VL, set of CDRs or heavy CDR3, heavy and/or light chain or any variant of these components described herein. Additional embodiments provide PCSK9-specific antagonists including but not limited to monoclonal antibodies that recognize/bind to SEQ ID NO: 37, SEQ ID NO: 39 or SEQ ID NO: 41, wherein the PCSK9-specific antagonists bind to human and/or murine PCSK9 with a K.sub.D of 1.2.times.10.sup.-6 M or less, and wherein the PCSK9-specific antagonist competes with 1D05 for binding to PCSK9. In specific embodiments hereof, the PCSK9-specific antagonists are further defined by one or more of the following qualities: they (i) reduce 1D05 binding by at least 50% at 1 .mu.M or less with 1D05 at or below its K.sub.D, (ii) block PCSK9 binding to the LDL receptor, (iii) inhibit PCSK9 internalization into the cell, and/or (iv) comprise a specific antigen-binding region, VH, VL, set of CDRs or heavy CDR3, heavy and/or light chain or any variant of these components described herein. In specific embodiments, the PCSK9-specific antagonists in accordance with the above comprise (i) the disclosed heavy and/or light chain variable region CDR3 sequences (SEQ ID NOs: 17 and 7, respectively), (ii) the disclosed heavy and/or light chain variable regions CDR1 (SEQ ID NOs: 13 and 3, respectively), CDR2 (SEQ ID NOs: 15 and 5, respectively) and CDR3 (SEQ ID NOs; 17 and 7, respectively, (iii) the full complement (SEQ ID NOs; 13, 15, 17, 3, 5 and 7) of disclosed heavy and light chain CDRs within a variable region framework of a human heavy and/or light chain sequence; (iv) the disclosed VL and/or VH regions (SEQ ID NOs: 27 and 11, respectively); (v) the disclosed light and/or Fd chains (SEQ ID NO: 1 and amino acids 1-233 of SEQ ID NO: 9 (or SEQ ID NO: 9)), or (vi) the disclosed light and/or heavy chains (SEQ ID NOs: 26 and 25). In specific embodiments, the PCSK9-specific antagonists bind to/recognize both SEQ ID NOs: 37 and SEQ ID NO: 42.                In any of the above assays for identifying antibodies binding the same or overlapping epitope region as 1D05, binding of the known binder (i.e., 1D05 antibody molecule known to bind residues Arg194, Glu197 and Arg199 of SEQ ID NO: 37) as compared to the binding of the candidate binder should be distinguishable. This can (but need not) be accomplished through the use of labels on either or both molecules as will be readily appreciated by the skilled artisan. Labels, as used herein, refer to another molecule or agent incorporated into/affixed to the antibody molecule. In one embodiment, the label is a detectable marker, e.g., a radiolabeled amino acid or attachment to a polypeptide of biotinyl moieties that can be detected by marked avidin (e.g., streptavidin containing a fluorescent marker or enzymatic activity that can be detected by optical or colorimetric methods). Various methods of labeling polypeptides and glycoproteins are known in the art and may be used. Examples of labels for polypeptides include, but are not limited to, the following: radioisotopes or radionuclides (e.g., .sup.3H, .sup.14C, .sup.15N, .sup.35S, .sup.90Y, .sup.99Tc, .sup.111In, .sup.125I, .sup.131I), fluorescent labels (e.g., FITC, rhodamine, lanthanide phosphors), enzymatic labels (e.g., horseradish peroxidase, .beta.-galactosidase, luciferase, alkaline phosphatase), chemiluminescent markers, biotinyl groups, predetermined polypeptide epitopes recognized by a secondary reporter (e.g., leucine zipper pair sequences, binding sites for secondary antibodies, metal binding domains, epitope tags), magnetic agents, such as gadolinium chelates, toxins such as pertussis toxin, taxol, cytochalasin B, gramicidin D, ethidium bromide, emetine, mitomycin, etoposide, tenoposide, vincristine, vinblastine, colchicin, doxorubicin, daunorubicin, dihydroxy anthracin dione, mitoxantrone, mithramycin, actinomycin D, 1-dehydrotestosterone, glucocorticoids, procaine, tetracaine, lidocaine, propranolol, and puromycin and analogs or homologs thereof. In some embodiments, labels are attached by spacer arms of various lengths to reduce potential steric hindrance.                A 1D05 antibody used for the competition assays may be any antibody molecule which is of the 1D05 description provided herein (i.e. any antibody molecule selective for PCSK9 which comprises a VL comprising SEQ ID NO: 27 and a VH comprising SEQ ID NO: 11). Examples of such antibodies include without limitation (i) a Fab which comprises a light chain comprising SEQ ID NO: 1 and an Fd chain comprising amino acids 1-233 of SEQ ID NO: 9 (or SEQ ID NO: 9); (ii) a full length antibody molecule which comprises a light chain comprising SEQ ID NO: 26 and a heavy chain comprising SEQ ID NO: 25.                Peptides or peptidomimetics based on the regions corresponding to SEQ ID NO: 39 or SEQ ID NO: 41 (and in select embodiments the areas corresponding to SEQ ID NO: 37 and SEQ ID NO: 42) should have antagonistic properties by preventing the interaction of PCSK9 with LDLR. Importantly, peptides that comprise SEQ ID NO: 37 and SEQ ID NO: 42 should generate neutralizing antibodies able to inhibit PCSK9 binding to LDLR and/or inhibit PCSK9 internalization into cells.                In specific embodiments, peptides encompassed herein comprise SEQ ID NO: 39 OR SEQ ID NO: 41. In select embodiments, the peptides comprise SEQ ID NO: 37 and are less than 50 amino acids. In certain embodiments, the peptides comprise both SEQ ID NO: 37 and SEQ ID NO: 42 and are 40 amino acids or less. In more specific embodiments, the peptides comprise SEQ ID NO: 37 and are less than 40 amino acids, less than 30 amino acids, less than 20 amino acids, or less than 10 amino acids.                Screening of peptides of the invention may be carried out utilizing competition assays as described above. If the peptide being tested competes with a 1D05 antibody molecule (i.e. any antibody molecule selective for PCSK9 which comprises a VL comprising SEQ ID NO: 27 and a VH comprising SEQ ID NO: 11) as shown by a decrease in binding of such 1D05 antibody molecule then it is likely that the peptide and 1D05 bind to the same, or a closely related, epitope. Still another way to determine whether a peptide has the specificity of the 1D05 antibody molecule is to pre-incubate the 1D05 antibody molecule with PCSK9 with which it is normally reactive, and then add the peptide being tested with demonstrated specificity for PCSK9 to determine whether the peptide is inhibited in its ability to bind PCSK9. If the peptide being tested is inhibited then, in all likelihood, it has the same, or a functionally equivalent, epitope and specificity as the 1D05 antibody molecule.                Using routine procedures as outlined throughout the instant specification and well known to those of ordinary skill in the art, one can then determine whether a peptide which binds to PCSK9 is useful by determining whether the peptide is blocks PCSK9 from binding to the LDL receptor and/or prevents PCSK9 internalization into cells.                Expression and selection of any of the PCSK9-specific antagonists described in the present application may be achieved using suitable technologies including, but not limited to phage display (see, e.g., International Application Number WO 92/01047, Kay et al., 1996 Phage Display of Peptides and Proteins: A Laboratory Manual, San Diego: Academic Press), yeast display, bacterial display, T7 display, and ribosome display (see, e.g., Lowe & Jermutus, 2004 Curr. Pharm. Biotech. 517-527).                Particular PCSK9-specific antagonists forming part of the present invention are antibody molecules or antibodies. \"Antibody molecule\" or \"Antibody\" as described herein refers to an immunoglobulin-derived structure with selective binding to human and/or murine PCSK9 including, but not limited to, a full length or whole antibody, an antigen binding fragment (a fragment derived, physically or conceptually, from an antibody structure), a derivative of any of the foregoing, a fusion of any of the foregoing with another polypeptide, or any alternative structure/composition which incorporates any of the foregoing for purposes of selectively binding to/inhibiting the function of PCSK9.                \"Whole\" antibodies or \"full length\" antibodies refer to proteins that comprise two heavy (H) and two light (L) chains inter-connected by disulfide bonds which comprise: (1) in terms of the heavy chains, a variable region (abbreviated herein as \"V.sub.H\") and a heavy chain constant region which comprises three domains, C.sub.H1, C.sub.H2, and C.sub.H3; and (2) in terms of the light chains, a light chain variable region (abbreviated herein as \"V.sub.L\") and a light chain constant region which comprises one domain, C.sub.L.                Antibody fragments and, more specifically, antigen binding fragments are molecules possessing an antibody variable region or segment thereof (which comprises one or more of the disclosed CDR 3 domains, heavy and/or light within framework regions of heavy and/or light chains, as appropriate), which confers selective binding to PCSK9, and particularly human and/or murine PCSK9. Antibody fragments containing such an antibody variable region include, but are not limited to the following antibody molecules: a Fab, a F(ab')2, a Fd, a Fv, a scFv, bispecific antibody molecules (antibody molecules comprising a PCSK9-specific antibody or antigen binding fragment as disclosed herein linked to a second functional moiety having a different binding specificity than the antibody, including, without limitation, another peptide or protein such as an antibody, or receptor ligand), a bispecific single chain Fv dimer, an isolated CDR3, a minibody, a `scAb`, a dAb fragment, a diabody, a triabody, a tetrabody, a minibody, and artificial antibodies based upon protein scaffolds, including but not limited to fibronectin type III polypeptide antibodies (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,703,199 and International Application Numbers WO 02/32925 and WO 00/34784) or cytochrome B; see, e.g., Nygren et al., 1997 Curr. Opinion Struct. Biol. 7:463-469; the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. The antibody portions or binding fragments may be natural, or partly or wholly synthetically produced. Such antibody portions can be prepared by various means known by one of skill in the art, including, but not limited to, conventional techniques, such as papain or pepsin digestion.                The term \"isolated\" as used herein in reference to antibody molecules, PCSK9-specific antagonists in general, encoding nucleic acid or other describes a property as it pertains to the disclosed PCSK9-specific antagonists, nucleic acid or other that makes them different from that found in nature. The difference can be, for example, that they are of a different purity than that found in nature, or that they are of a different structure or form part of a different structure than that found in nature. A structure not found in nature, for example, includes recombinant human immunoglobulin structures including, but not limited to, recombinant human immunoglobulin structures with optimized CDRs. Other examples of structures not found in nature are PCSK9-specific antagonists or nucleic acid substantially free of other cellular material. Isolated PCSK9-specific antagonists are generally free of other protein-specific antagonists having different protein specificities (i.e., possess an affinity for other than PCSK9).                In one particular aspect, the present invention provides isolated PCSK9-specific antagonists which antagonize PCSK9 function. In particular embodiments, said PCSK9-specific antagonists inhibit human and/or murine PCSK9's antagonism of cellular LDL uptake by interfering with PCSK9 binding to the LDL receptor and resultant PCSK9 cell internalization. Disclosed PCSK9-specific antagonists, thus, form desirable molecules for lowering plasma LDL-cholesterol levels; see, e.g., Cohen et al., 2005 Nat. Genet. 37:161-165 (wherein significantly lower plasma LDL cholesterol levels were noted in individuals heterozygous for a nonsense mutation in allele PCSK9); Rashid et al., 2005 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 102:5374-5379 (wherein PCSK9-knockout mice evidenced increased numbers of LDLRs in hepatocytes, accelerated plasma LDL clearance, and significantly lower plasma cholesterol levels); and Cohen et al., 2006 N. Engl. J. Med. 354:1264-1272 (wherein humans heterozygous for mutated, loss of function, PCSK9 exhibited a significant reduction in the long-term risk of developing atherosclerotic heart disease).                Through repeat experiments, 1D05 antibody molecules as disclosed herein dose-dependently inhibited the effects of both human and/or murine PCSK9 on LDL uptake. In specific embodiments, the present invention, thus, encompasses PCSK9-specific antagonists and, in more specific embodiments, antibody molecules comprising the heavy and/or light chain variable regions (SEQ ID NO: 11 and 27, respectively) contained within these 1D05 antibody molecules or the heavy and/or light chains, e.g., amino acids 1-233 of SEQ ID NO: 9 (or SEQ ID NO: 9) and SEQ ID NO: 1, respectively, or SEQ ID NOs: 25 and 26, respectively, as well as equivalents (characterized as having one or more conservative amino acid substitutions that do not degrade the PCSK9-selective property of 1D05) or homologs thereof. Particular embodiments comprise isolated PCSK9-specific antagonists that comprise the CDR domains disclosed herein or sets of heavy and/or light chain CDR domains disclosed herein, or equivalents thereof, characterized as having one or more conservative amino acid substitutions.                Use of the terms \"domain\" or \"region\" herein simply refers to the respective portion of the antibody molecule wherein the sequence or segment at issue will reside or, in the alternative, currently resides.                In specific embodiments, the present invention provides isolated PCSK9-specific antagonists and, in more specific embodiments, antibody molecules comprising a heavy chain variable region which comprises SEQ ID NO: 11; equivalents thereof characterized as having one or more conservative amino acid substitutions, and homologs thereof. The disclosed antagonists should counteract or inhibit human and/or murine PCSK9-dependent inhibition of cellular LDL uptake. In specific embodiments, the present invention provides homologs of the disclosed antagonists characterized as being at least 90% identical over the heavy chain variable region to SEQ ID NO: 11; said antagonists which inhibit human and/or murine PCSK9-dependent inhibition of cellular LDL uptake by at least 10%.                In specific embodiments, the present invention provides isolated PCSK9-specific antagonists and, in more specific embodiments, antibody molecules comprising a light chain variable region which comprises SEQ ID NO: 27; equivalents thereof characterized as having one or more conservative amino acid substitutions, and homologs thereof. The disclosed antagonists should counteract or inhibit human and/or murine PCSK9-dependent inhibition of cellular LDL uptake. In specific embodiments, the present invention provides homologs of the disclosed antagonists characterized as being at least 90% identical over the light chain variable region to SEQ ID NO: 27; said antagonists which inhibit human and/or murine PCSK9-dependent inhibition of cellular LDL uptake by at least 10%.

In specific embodiments herein the CDRs are in place of the corresponding regions of 1D05 with out without conservative amino acid substitutions; specific embodiments of which inhibit human and/or murine PCSK9-dependent inhibition of cellular LDL uptake by at least 10%. In particular embodiments, the present invention encompasses isolated PCSK9-specific antagonists and, in more specific embodiments, antibody molecules comprising heavy and/or light chain variable regions comprising SEQ ID NOs: 50 and 49, respectively; said variants SEQ ID NOs which are not SEQ ID NOs: 11 and 27, respectively; specific embodiments of which inhibit human and/or murine PCSK9-dependent inhibition of cellular LDL uptake by at least 10%.                Specific embodiments include any isolated PCSK9-specific antagonist and, in more specific embodiments, antibody molecules which comprise heavy chain variable region sequence found in any of SEQ ID NOs: 51-56, optionally comprising a light chain variable region sequence disclosed herein (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 27); specific embodiments of which inhibit human and/or murine PCSK9-dependent inhibition of cellular LDL uptake by at least 10%. Other embodiments include any isolated PCSK9-specific antagonist and, in more specific embodiments, antibody molecules which comprise light chain variable region sequence found in any of SEQ ID NOs: 57-60, optionally comprising a heavy chain variable region sequence disclosed herein (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 11); specific embodiments of which inhibit human and/or murine PCSK9-dependent inhibition of cellular LDL uptake by at least 10%.                Particular embodiments are isolated PCSK9-specific antagonists which comprise the above-described VH and VL regions in a full length antibody. Specific embodiments herein further comprise a series of amino acids selected from the group consisting of: SEQ ID NO: 21 (IgG1), SEQ ID NO: 22 (IgG2), SEQ ID NO: 23 (IgG4) and SEQ ID NO: 24 (IgG2 m4).                Conservative amino acid substitutions, as one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate, are substitutions that replace an amino acid residue with one imparting similar or better (for the intended purpose) functional and/or chemical characteristics. Antagonists bearing such conservative amino acid substitutions can be tested for retained or better activity using functional assays available in the art or described herein. PCSK9-specific antagonists possessing one or more conservative amino acid substitutions which retain the ability to selectively bind to human PCSK9 and antagonize PCSK9 functioning at a level the same or better than 1D05 antibody molecules as described herein are referred to herein as \"functional equivalents\" of the disclosed antagonists and form specific embodiments of the present invention. Conservative amino acid substitutions are often ones in which the amino acid residue is replaced with an amino acid residue having a similar side chain. Families of amino acid residues having similar side chains have been defined in the art. These families include amino acids with basic side chains (e.g., lysine, arginine, histidine), acidic side chains (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid), uncharged polar side chains (e.g., glycine, asparagine, glutamine, serine, threonine, tyrosine, cysteine, tryptophan), nonpolar side chains (e.g., alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, methionine), beta-branched side chains (e.g., threonine, valine, isoleucine) and aromatic side chains (e.g., tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, histidine). Such modifications are not designed to significantly reduce or alter the binding or functional inhibition characteristics of the PCSK9-specific antagonist, albeit they may improve such properties. The purpose for making a substitution is not significant and can include, but is by no means limited to, replacing a residue with one better able to maintain or enhance the structure of the molecule, the charge or hydrophobicity of the molecule, or the size of the molecule. For instance, one may desire simply to substitute a less desired residue with one of the same polarity or charge. Such modifications can be introduced by standard techniques known in the art, such as site-directed mutagenesis and PCR-mediated mutagenesis. One specific means by which those of skill in the art accomplish conservative amino acid substitutions is alanine scanning mutagenesis as discussed in, for example, MacLennan et al., 1998 Acta Physiol. Scand. Suppl. 643:55-67, and Sasaki et al., 1998 Adv. Biophys. 35:1-24.                In another aspect, the present invention provides isolated PCSK9-specific antagonists and, in more specific embodiments, antibody molecules which comprise heavy and/or light chain variable regions comprising amino acid sequences that are homologous to the corresponding amino acid sequences of the disclosed antibodies, wherein the antibody molecules inhibit PCSK9-dependent inhibition of cellular LDL uptake. Specific embodiments are antagonists which comprise heavy and/or light chain variable regions which are at least 90% identical to disclosed heavy and/or light chain variable regions, respectively. Reference to \"at least 90% identical\" includes at least 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99 and 100% identical sequences along the full length of the molecule disclosed herein.                PCSK9-specific antagonists with amino acid sequences homologous to the amino acid sequences of antagonists described herein are typically produced to improve one or more of the properties of the antagonist without negatively impacting its specificity for PCSK9. One method of obtaining such sequences, which is not the only method available to the skilled artisan, is to mutate sequence encoding the PCSK9-specific antagonist or specificity-determining region(s) thereof, express an antagonist comprising the mutated sequence(s), and test the encoded antagonist for retained function using available functional assays including those described herein. Mutation may be by site-directed or random mutagenesis. As one of skill in the art will appreciate, however, other methods of mutagenesis can readily bring about the same effect. For example, in certain methods, the spectrum of mutants are constrained by non-randomly targeting conservative substitutions based on either amino acid chemical or structural characteristics, or else by protein structural considerations. In affinity maturation experiments, several such mutations may be found in a single selected molecule, whether they are randomly or non-randomly selected. There are also various structure-based approaches toward affinity maturation as demonstrated in, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 7,117,096, PCT Pub. Nos.: WO 02/084277 and WO 03/099999; the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.                As used herein, the percent homology between two amino acid or nucleic acid sequences is equivalent to the percent identity between the two sequences, and these two terms will be used interchangeably throughout. As used herein, % identity of two nucleic acid or amino acid sequences is determined using the algorithm of Karlin and Altschul (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:5873-5877, 1993). Such an algorithm is incorporated into the NBLAST and XBLAST programs of Altschul et al., 1990 J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-410. BLAST nucleotide searches are performed with the NBLAST program, score=100, wordlength=12, to obtain nucleic acid sequences homologous to a nucleic acid molecule of the invention. BLAST protein searches are performed with the XBLAST program, score=50, wordlength=3, to obtain amino acid sequences homologous to an amino acid sequence disclosed herein. To obtain gapped alignments for comparison purposes, Gapped BLAST is utilized as described in Altschul et al., 1997 Nucleic Acids Res. 25:3389-3402. When utilizing BLAST and Gapped BLAST programs, the default parameters of the respective programs (e.g., XBLAST and NBLAST) are used.                Utilization of components of one or more disclosed PCSK9-specific molecules to produce other binding molecules with similar or better specificity is well within the realm of one skilled in the art. This can be accomplished, for example, using techniques of recombinant DNA technology. One specific example of this involves the introduction of DNA encoding the immunoglobulin variable region, or one or more of the CDRs, of an antibody to the variable region, constant region, or constant region plus framework regions, as appropriate, of a different immunoglobulin. Such molecules form important aspects of the present invention. Specific immunoglobulins or the corresponding sequences, into which particular disclosed sequences may be inserted or, in the alternative, form the essential part of, include but are not limited to the following antibody molecules which form particular embodiments of the present invention: a Fab (monovalent fragment with variable light (VL), variable heavy (VH), constant light (CL) and constant heavy 1 (CH1) domains), a F(ab').sub.2 (bivalent fragment comprising two Fab fragments linked by a disulfide bridge or alternative at the hinge region), a Fd (VH and CH1 domains), a Fv (VL and VH domains), a scFv (a single chain Fv where VL and VH are joined by a linker, e.g., a peptide linker, see, e.g., Bird et al., 1988 Science 242:423-426, Huston et al., 1988 PNAS USA 85:5879-5883), a bispecific antibody molecule (an antibody molecule comprising a PCSK9-specific antibody or antigen binding fragment as disclosed herein linked to a second functional moiety having a different binding specificity than the antibody, including, without limitation, another peptide or protein such as an antibody, or receptor ligand), a bispecific single chain Fv dimer (see, e.g., PCT/US92/09965), an isolated CDR3, a minibody (single chain-CH.sub.3 fusion that self assembles into a bivalent dimer of about 80 kDa), a `scAb` (an antibody fragment containing VH and VL as well as either CL or CH1), a dAb fragment (VH domain, see, e.g., Ward et al., 1989 Nature 341:544-546, and McCafferty et al., 1990 Nature 348:552-554; or VL domain; Holt et al., 2003 Trends in Biotechnology 21:484-489), a diabody (see, e.g., Holliger et al., 1993 PNAS USA 90:6444-6448 and International Application Number WO 94/13804), a triabody, a tetrabody, a minibody (a scFv joined to a CH.sub.3; see, e.g., Hu et al., 1996 Cancer Res. 56:3055-3061), IgG, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgM, IgD, IgA, IgE or any derivatives thereof, and artificial antibodies based upon protein scaffolds, including but not limited to fibronectin type III polypeptide antibodies (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,703,199 and International Application Number WO 02/32925) or cytochrome B; see, e.g., Koide et al., 1998 J. Molec. Biol. 284:1141-1151, and Nygren et al., 1997 Current Opinion in Structural Biology 7:463-469; the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. Certain antibody molecules including, but not limited to, Fv, scFv, diabody molecules or domain antibodies (Domantis) may be stabilized by incorporating disulfide bridges to line the VH and VL domains, see, e.g., Reiter et al., 1996 Nature Biotech. 14:1239-1245; the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Bispecific antibodies may be produced using conventional technologies (see, e.g., Holliger & Winter, 1993 Current Opinion Biotechnol. 4:446-449, specific methods of which include production chemically, or from hybrid hybridomas) and other technologies including, but not limited to, the BiTE.TM. technology (molecules possessing antigen binding regions of different specificity with a peptide linker) and knobs-into-holes engineering (see, e.g., Ridgeway et al., 1996 Protein Eng. 9:616-621; the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference). Bispecific diabodies may be produced in E. coli, and these molecules as other PCSK9-specific antagonists, as one of skill in the art will appreciate, may be selected using phage display in the appropriate libraries (see, e.g., International Application Number WO 94/13804; the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference).                Variable domains, into which CDRs of interest are inserted, may be obtained from any germ-line or rearranged human variable domain. Variable domains may also be synthetically produced. The CDR regions can be introduced into the respective variable domains using recombinant DNA technology. One means by which this can be achieved is described in Marks et al., 1992 Bio/Technology 10:779-783; the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. A variable heavy domain may be paired with a variable light domain to provide an antigen binding site. In addition, independent regions (e.g., a variable heavy domain alone) may be used to bind antigen. The artisan is well aware, as well, that two domains of an Fv fragment, VL and VH, while perhaps coded by separate genes, may be joined, using recombinant methods, by a synthetic linker that enables them to be made as a single protein chain in which the VL and VH regions pair to form monovalent molecules (scFvs).                Specific embodiments provide the CDR(s) in germline framework regions. Framework regions, including but not limited to human framework regions, are known to those of skill in the art (e.g., a human or non-human framework). The framework regions may be naturally occurring or consensus framework regions. In one aspect, the framework region of an antibody of the invention is human (see, e.g., Clothia et al., 1998 J. Mol. Biol. 278:457-479 for a listing of human framework regions; said disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). Specific embodiments herein provide heavy chain variable CDR3 SEQ ID NO: 17 into VH1A.sub.--3 in place of the relevant CDR. Specific embodiments herein provide heavy chain variable CDR1, CDR2 and/or CDR3 sequences (SEQ ID NO:s 13, 15 and 17, respectively) into VH1A.sub.--3 in place of the relevant CDRs. Specific embodiments herein provide light chain variable CDR3 SEQ ID NO: 7 into VK1.sub.--4 in place of the relevant CDR. Specific embodiments herein provide light chain variable CDR1, CDR2 and/or CDR3 sequences (SEQ ID NO:s 3, 5 and 7, respectively) into VK1.sub.--4 in place of the relevant CDRs. Specific embodiments further provide heavy chain variable CDR3 SEQ ID NO: 17 and light chain variable CDR3 SEQ ID NO: 7 into VH1A.sub.--3 and VK14 germline sequences, respectively. Further embodiments, provide heavy chain variable CDR1, CDR2 and/or CDR3 sequences (SEQ ID NO:s 13, 15 and 17, respectively) into VH1A.sub.--3 in place of the relevant CDRs; and light chain variable CDR1, CDR2 and/or CDR3 sequences (SEQ ID NO:s 3, 5 and 7, respectively) into VK1.sub.--4 in place of the relevant CDRs.                The present invention encompasses antibody molecules that are human, humanized, deimmunized, chimeric and primatized. The invention also encompasses antibody molecules produced by the process of veneering; see, e.g., Mark et al., 1994 Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology, vol. 113: The pharmacology of monoclonal Antibodies, Springer-Verlag, pp. 105-134; the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. \"Human\" in reference to the disclosed antibody molecules specifically refers to antibody molecules having variable and/or constant regions derived from human germline immunoglobulin sequences, wherein said sequences may, but need not, be modified/altered to have certain amino acid substitutions or residues that are not encoded by human germline immunoglobulin sequence. Such mutations can be introduced by methods including, but not limited to, random or site-specific mutagenesis in vitro, or by somatic mutation in vivo. Specific examples of mutation techniques discussed in the literature are that disclosed in Gram et al., 1992 PNAS USA 89:3576-3580; Barbas et al., 1994 PNAS USA 91:3809-3813, and Schier et al., 1996 J. Mol. Biol. 263:551-567; the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. These are only specific examples and do not represent the only available techniques. There are a plethora of mutation techniques in the scientific literature which are available to, and widely appreciated by, the skilled artisan. \"Humanized\" in reference to the disclosed antibody molecules refers specifically to antibody molecules wherein CDR sequences derived from another mammalian species, such as a mouse, are grafted onto human framework sequences. \"Primatized\" in reference to the disclosed antibody molecules refers to antibody molecules wherein CDR sequences of a non-primate are inserted into primate framework sequences, see, e.g., WO 93/02108 and WO 99/55369; the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.                Specific antibodies of the present invention are monoclonal antibodies and, in particular embodiments, are in one of the following antibody formats: IgD, IgA, IgE, IgM, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4 or any derivative of any of the foregoing. The language \"derivatives thereof\" or \"derivatives\" in this respect includes, inter alia, (i) antibodies and antibody molecules with conservative modifications in one or both variable regions (i.e., VH and/or VL), (ii) antibodies and antibody molecules with manipulations in the constant regions of the heavy and/or light chains, and/or (iii) antibodies and antibody molecules that contain additional chemical moieties which are not normally a part of the immunoglobulin molecule (e.g., pegylation).                Manipulations of the variable regions can be within one or more of the VH and/or VL CDR regions. Site-directed mutagenesis, random mutagenesis or other method for generating sequence or molecule diversity can be utilized to create mutants which can subsequently be tested for a particular functional property of interest in available in vitro or in vivo assays including those described herein.                Antibodies of the present invention also include those in which modifications have been made to the framework residues within VH and/or VL to improve one or more properties of the antibody of interest. Typically, such framework modifications are made to decrease the immunogenicity of the antibody. For example, one approach is to \"backmutate\" one or more framework residues to the corresponding germline sequence. More specifically, an antibody that has undergone somatic mutation may contain framework residues that differ from the germline sequence from which the antibody is derived. Such residues can be identified by comparing the antibody framework sequences to the germline sequences from which the antibody is derived. Such \"backmutated\" antibodies are also intended to be encompassed by the invention. Another type of framework modification involves mutating one or more residues within the framework region, or even within one or more CDR regions, to remove T cell epitopes to thereby reduce the potential immunogenicity of the antibody. This approach is also referred to as \"deimmunization\" and is described in further detail in U.S. Patent Publication No. 20030153043 by Carr et al; the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.                In addition or alternative to modifications made within the framework or CDR regions, antibodies of the invention may be engineered to include modifications within the Fc or constant regions, where present, typically to alter one or more functional properties of the antibody, such as serum half-life, complement fixation, Fc receptor binding, and/or antigen-dependent cellular cytotoxicity.                The concept of generating \"hybrids\" or \"combinatorial\" IgG forms comprising various antibody isotypes to hone in on desired effector functionality has generally been described; see, e.g., Tao et al., 1991 J. Exp. Med. 173:1025-1028. A specific embodiment of the present invention encompasses antibody molecules that possess specific manipulations in the Fc region which have been found to result in reduced or altered binding to Fc.gamma.R receptors, C1q or FcRn on the part of the antibody. The present invention, therefore, encompasses antibodies in accordance with the present description that do not provoke (or provoke to a lesser extent) antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (\"ADCC\"), complement-mediated cytotoxicity (\"CMC\"), or form immune complexes, while retaining normal pharmacokinetic (\"PK\") properties. Specific embodiments of the present invention provide an antibody molecule as defined in accordance with the present invention which comprises, as part of its immunoglobulin structure, SEQ ID NO: 24 and, in particular embodiments, residues 107-326 of SEQ ID NO: 24 as part of the immunoglobulin structure. The present invention encompasses antibody molecules which comprise: (i) a light chain comprising SEQ ID NO: 1, and (ii) a heavy chain comprising SEQ ID NO: 11 in sequence with (adjacent to) or followed by a series of amino acids selected from the group consisting of: SEQ ID NO: 21 (IgG1), SEQ ID NO: 22 (IgG2), SEQ ID NO: 23 (IgG4) and SEQ ID NO: 24 (IgG2 m4). FIG. 6 illustrates a comparison of sequence comprising SEQ ID NO: 24, particularly IgG2 m4, with IgG1, IgG2, and IgG4. Amino acid sequences for mature, secreted anti-PCSK9 IgG2 m4 heavy and light chains can be found as SEQ ID NOs: 25 and 26, respectively. Antibody molecules encoded at least in part by said sequence are encompassed herein.                Specific PCSK9-specific antagonists may carry a detectable label, or may be conjugated to a toxin (e.g., a cytotoxin), a radioactive isotope, a radionuclide, a liposome, a targeting moiety, a biosensor, a cationic tail, or an enzyme (e.g., via a peptidyl bond or linker). Such PCSK9-specific antagonist compositions form an additional aspect of the present invention.                In another aspect, the present invention provides isolated nucleic acid encoding disclosed PCSK9-specific antagonists. \"Isolated\" as mentioned prior refers to the property of the thing referred to that makes them different from that found in nature. The difference can be, for example, that they are of a different purity than that found in nature, or that they are of a different structure or form part of a different structure than that found in nature. An example of nucleic acid not found in nature is, for example, nucleic acid substantially free of other cellular material. The nucleic acid may be present in whole cells, in a cell lysate, or in a partially purified or substantially pure form. In specific instances, a nucleic acid may be isolated when purified away from other cellular components or other contaminants, e.g., other cellular nucleic acids or proteins, for example, using standard techniques, including without limitation, alkaline/SDS treatment, CsCl banding, column chromatography, agarose gel electrophoresis and other suitable methods known in the art. The nucleic acid may include DNA (inclusive of cDNA) and/or RNA. Nucleic acids of the present invention can be obtained using standard molecular biology techniques. For antibodies expressed by hybridomas (e.g., hybridomas prepared from transgenic mice carrying human immunoglobulin genes), cDNAs encoding the light and heavy chains of the antibody made by the hybridoma can be obtained by standard PCR amplification or cDNA cloning techniques. For antibodies obtained from an immunoglobulin gene library (e.g., using phage display techniques), nucleic acid encoding the antibody can be recovered from the library.

The present invention further provides in specific embodiments, homologs of the antagonists disclosed above, characterized as being at least 90% identical over the heavy and/or light chains to the corresponding sequences of 1D05.                Specific embodiments of the present invention encompass nucleic acid encoding antibody molecules that possess manipulations in the Fc region which result in reduced or altered binding to Fc.gamma.R receptors, C1q, or FcRn on the part of the antibody. One specific embodiment of the present invention is isolated nucleic acid which encodes for antibody molecules comprising as part of their immunoglobulin structure SEQ ID NO: 24 and, in particular embodiments, residues 107-326 of SEQ ID NO: 24. In specific embodiments, synthetic PCSK9-specific antagonists can be produced by expression from nucleic acid generated from oligonucleotides synthesized and assembled within suitable expression vectors; see, e.g., Knappick et al., 2000 J. Mol. Biol. 296:57-86, and Krebs et al., 2001 J. Immunol. Methods 254:67-84.                The present invention encompasses nucleic acid encoding antibody molecules which comprise: (i) nucleic acid encoding a light chain comprising SEQ ID NO: 1 (specific embodiments of which comprise nucleic acid SEQ ID NO: 2), and (ii) nucleic acid encoding a heavy chain comprising SEQ ID NO: 11 (specific embodiments of which comprise nucleic acid SEQ ID NO: 12) followed in sequence by (adjacent to) a set of nucleotides encoding for a set of amino acids selected from the group consisting of: SEQ ID NO: 21 (IgG1), SEQ ID NO: 22 (IgG2), SEQ ID NO: 23 (IgG4) and SEQ ID NO: 24 (IgG2 m4). Nucleotide sequences for mature, secreted anti-PCSK9 IgG2 m4 heavy and light chains can be found as SEQ ID NOs: 29 and 30, respectively. Plasmid sequences comprising heavy and light chain 1D05 anti-PCSK9 IgG2 m4 antibody molecules can be found as SEQ ID NOs: 31 and 32, respectively. Nucleic acid encoding such antibody molecules form important embodiments hereof.                Also included within the present invention are isolated nucleic acids comprising nucleotide sequences which are at least about 90% identical and more preferably at least about 95% identical to the full length of the nucleotide sequences described herein, and which nucleotide sequences encode PCSK9-specific antagonists which inhibit PCSK9-dependent inhibition of cellular LDL uptake by at least 10%.                Reference to \"at least about 90% identical\" throughout the application includes at least about 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99 or 100% identical.                The invention further provides isolated nucleic acid at least a portion of which hybridizes to the complement of nucleic acid consisting of SEQ ID NO: 12 and/or SEQ ID NO: 28 under stringent hybridization conditions, said nucleic acid of which confers upon antibody molecules the ability to specifically bind PCSK9 and antagonize PCSK9 function, and PCSK9-specific antagonists expressed employing said nucleic acid. Methods for hybridizing nucleic acids are well-known in the art; see, e.g., Ausubel, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, N.Y., 6.3.1-6.3.6, 1989. Stringent hybridization conditions involve hybridizing at 68.degree. C. in 5.times.SSC/5.times.Denhardt's solution (or equivalent)/1.0% SDS, and washing in 0.2.times.SSC/0.1% SDS at room temperature. Moderately stringent conditions include washing in 3.times.SSC at 42.degree. C. The parameters of salt concentration and temperature can be varied to achieve the optimal level of identity between the probe and the target nucleic acid. The skilled artisan can manipulate various hybridization and/or washing conditions to specifically target nucleic acid in the hybridizing portion that is at least 80, 85, 90, 95, 98, or 99% identical to SEQ ID NO: 12 and/or SEQ ID NO: 28. Basic parameters affecting the choice of hybridization conditions and guidance for devising suitable conditions are set forth by Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., chapters 9 and 11, 1989 and Ausubel et al. (eds), Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., sections 2.10 and 6.3-6.4, 1995 (the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference), and can be readily determined by those having ordinary skill in the art. PCSK9 antagonists having one or more variable regions comprising nucleic acid which hybridizes to the complement of nucleic acid consisting of SEQ ID NO: 12 and/or SEQ ID NO: 28 under stringent hybridization conditions should be effective in antagonizing one or more functions of PCSK9. Said antagonists and encoding nucleic acid, thus, form important embodiments of the present invention.                In another aspect, the present invention provides vectors comprising the nucleic acid disclosed herein. Vectors in accordance with the present invention include, but are not limited to, plasmids and other expression constructs (e.g., phage or phagemid, as appropriate) suitable for the expression of the desired antibody molecule at the appropriate level for the intended purpose; see, e.g., Sambrook & Russell, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual: 3.sup.rd Edition, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. For most cloning purposes, DNA vectors may be used. Typical vectors include plasmids, modified viruses, bacteriophage, cosmids, yeast artificial chromosomes, bacterial artificial chromosomes, and other forms of episomal or integrated DNA. It is well within the purview of the skilled artisan to determine an appropriate vector for a particular gene transfer, generation of a recombinant PCSK9-specific antagonist, or other use. In specific embodiments, in addition to a recombinant gene, the vector may also contain an origin of replication for autonomous replication in a host cell, appropriate regulatory sequences, such as a promoter, a termination sequence, a polyadenylation sequence, an enhancer sequence, a selectable marker, a limited number of useful restriction enzyme sites, and/or other sequences as appropriate and the potential for high copy number. Examples of expression vectors for the production of protein-specific antagonists are well known in the art; see, e.g., Persic et al., 1997 Gene 187:9-18; Boel et al., 2000 J. Immunol. Methods 239:153-166, and Liang et al., 2001 J. Immunol. Methods 247:119-130; the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. If desired, nucleic acid encoding the antagonist may be integrated into the host chromosome using techniques well known in the art; see, e.g., Ausubel, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, 1999, and Marks et al., International Application Number WO 95/17516. Nucleic acid may also be expressed on plasmids maintained episomally or incorporated into an artificial chromosome; see, e.g., Csonka et al., 2000 J. Cell Science 113:3207-3216; Vanderbyl et al., 2002 Molecular Therapy 5:10. Specifically with regards to antibody molecules, the antibody light chain gene and the antibody heavy chain gene can be inserted into separate vectors or, more typically, both genes may be inserted into the same expression vector. Nucleic acid encoding any PCSK9-specific antagonist or component thereof can be inserted into an expression vector using standard methods (e.g., ligation of complementary restriction sites on the nucleic acid fragment and vector, or blunt end ligation if no restriction sites are present). Another specific example of how this may be carried out is through use of recombinational methods, e.g. the Clontech \"InFusion\" system, or Invitrogen \"TOPO\" system (both in vitro), or intracellularly (e.g. the Cre-Lox system). Specifically with regards to antibody molecules, the light and heavy chain variable regions can be used to create full-length antibody genes of any antibody isotype by inserting them into expression vectors already encoding heavy chain constant and light chain constant regions of the desired isotype such that the VH segment is operatively linked to the CH segment(s) within the vector and the VL segment is operatively linked to the CL segment within the vector. Additionally or alternatively, the recombinant expression vector comprising nucleic acid encoding a PCSK9-specific antagonist can encode a signal peptide that facilitates secretion of the antagonist from a host cell. The nucleic acid can be cloned into the vector such that the nucleic acid encoding a signal peptide is linked in-frame adjacent to the PCSK9-specific antagonist-encoding nucleic acid. The signal peptide may be an immunoglobulin or a non-immunoglobulin signal peptide. Any technique available to the skilled artisan may be employed to introduce the nucleic acid into the host cell; see, e.g., Morrison, 1985 Science, 229:1202. Methods of subcloning nucleic acid molecules of interest into expression vectors, transforming or transfecting host cells containing the vectors, and methods of making substantially pure protein comprising the steps of introducing the respective expression vector into a host cell, and cultivating the host cell under appropriate conditions are well known. The PCSK9-specific antagonist so produced may be harvested from the host cells in conventional ways. Techniques suitable for the introduction of nucleic acid into cells of interest will depend on the type of cell being used. General techniques include, but are not limited to, calcium phosphate transfection, DEAE-Dextran, electroporation, liposome-mediated transfection and transduction using viruses appropriate to the cell line of interest (e.g., retrovirus, vaccinia, baculovirus, or bacteriophage).                In another aspect, the present invention provides isolated cell(s) comprising nucleic acid encoding disclosed PCSK9-specific antagonists. A variety of different cell lines are contemplated herein and can be used for the recombinant production of PCSK9-specific antagonists, including but not limited to those from prokaryotic organisms (e.g., E. coli, Bacillus, and Streptomyces) and from eukaryotic (e.g., yeast, Baculovirus, and mammalian); see, e.g., Breitling et al., Recombinant antibodies, John Wiley & Sons, Inc. and Spektrum Akademischer Verlag, 1999; the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Plant cells, including transgenic plants, and animal cells, including transgenic animals (other than humans), comprising the nucleic acid or antagonists disclosed herein are also contemplated as part of the present invention. Suitable mammalian cells or cell lines including, but not limited to, those derived from Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO cells, including but not limited to DHFR--CHO cells (described in Urlaub and Chasin, 1980 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77:4216-4220) used, for example, with a DHFR selectable marker (e.g., as described in Kaufman and Sharp, 1982 Mol. Biol. 159:601-621), NSO myeloma cells (where a GS expression system as described in WO 87/04462, WO 89/01036, and EP 338,841 may be used), COS cells, SP2 cells, HeLa cells, baby hamster kidney cells, YB2/0 rat myeloma cells, human embryonic kidney cells, human embryonic retina cells, and others comprising the nucleic acid or antagonists disclosed herein form additional embodiments of the present invention; the preceding cited disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. Specific embodiments of the present invention comprising nucleic acid encoding disclosed PCSK9-specific antagonists include, but are not limited to, E. coli; see, e.g., Pluckthun, 1991 Bio/Technology 9:545-551, or yeast, such as Pichia, and recombinant derivatives thereof (see, e.g., Li et al., 2006 Nat. Biotechnol. 24:210-215); the preceding disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. Specific embodiments of the present invention relate to eukaryotic cells comprising nucleic acid encoding the disclosed PCSK9-specific antagonists, see, Chadd & Chamow, 2001 Current Opinion in Biotechnology 12:188-194, Andersen & Krummen, 2002 Current Opinion in Biotechnology 13:117, Larrick & Thomas, 2001 Current Opinion in Biotechnology 12:411-418; the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. Specific embodiments of the present invention relate to mammalian cells comprising nucleic acid encoding the disclosed PCSK9-specific antagonists which are able to produce PCSK9-specific antagonists with proper post translational modifications. Post translational modifications include, but are by no means limited to, disulfide bond formation and glycosylation. Another type of post translational modification is signal peptide cleavage. Preferred embodiments herein have the appropriate glycosylation; see, e., Yoo et al., 2002 J. Immunol. Methods 261:1-20; the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Naturally occurring antibodies contain at least one N-linked carbohydrate attached to a heavy chain. Id. Different types of mammalian host cells can be used to provide for efficient post-translational modifications. Examples of such host cells include Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO), HeLa, C6, PC12, and myeloma cells; see, Yoo et al., 2002 J. Immunol. Methods 261: 1-20, and Persic et al., 1997 Gene 187:9-18; the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.                In another aspect, the present invention provides isolated cell(s) comprising a polypeptide of the present invention.                In another aspect, the present invention provides a method of making a PCSK9-specific antagonist of the present invention, which comprises incubating a cell comprising nucleic acid encoding the PCSK9-specific antagonist, or a heavy and/or light chain or a fragment thereof (e.g., VH and/or VL, or one or more of the disclosed heavy and/or light chain variable region CDRs) of a desired PCSK9-specific antagonist (dictated by the desired antagonist) with specificity for human and/or murine PCSK9 under conditions that allow the expression of the PCSK9-specific antagonist, or the expression and assembly of said heavy and/or light chains or fragment into a PCSK9-specific antagonist, and isolating said PCSK9-specific antagonist from the cell. One example by which to generate particular desired heavy and/or light chain sequence or fragment is to first amplify (and modify) the germline heavy and/or light chain variable sequences or fragment using PCR. Germline sequence for human heavy and/or light variable regions are readily available to the skilled artisan, see, e.g., the \"Vbase\" human germline sequence database, and Kabat, E. A. et al., 1991 Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, Fifth Edition, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, NIH Publication No. 91-3242; Tomlinson, I. M. et al., 1992 \"The Repertoire of Human Germline VH Sequences Reveals about Fifty Groups of VH Segments with Different Hypervariable Loops\" J. Mol. Biol. 227:776-798; and Cox, J. P. L. et al., 1994 \"A Directory of Human Germ-line V.kappa. Segments Reveals a Strong Bias in their Usage\" Eur. J. Immunol. 24:827-836; the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. Mutagenesis of germline sequences may be carried out using standard methods, e.g., PCR-mediated mutagenesis where the mutations are incorporated into PCR primers, or site-directed mutagenesis. If full-length antibodies are desired, sequence is available for the human heavy chain constant region genes; see, e.g., Kabat. E. A. et al., 1991 Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, Fifth Edition, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, NIH Publication No. 91-3242. Fragments containing these regions may be obtained, for example, by standard PCR amplification. Alternatively, the skilled artisan can avail him/herself of vectors already encoding heavy and/or light chain constant regions.                Available techniques exist to recombinantly produce other antibody molecules which retain the specificity of an original antibody. A specific example of this is where DNA encoding the immunoglobulin variable region or the CDRs is introduced into the constant regions, or constant regions and framework regions, or simply the framework regions, of another antibody molecule; see, e.g., EP-184,187, GB 2188638, and EP-239400; the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. Cloning and expression of antibody molecules, including chimeric antibodies, are described in the literature; see, e.g., EP 0120694 and EP 0125023; the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.                Antibody molecules in accordance with the present invention may, in one instance, be raised and then screened for characteristics identified herein using known techniques. Basic techniques for the preparation of monoclonal antibodies are described in the literature, see, e.g., Kohler and Milstein (1975, Nature 256:495-497); the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Fully human monoclonal antibodies can be produced by available methods. These methods include, but are by no means limited to, the use of genetically engineered mouse strains which possess an immune system whereby the mouse antibody genes have been inactivated and in turn replaced with a repertoire of functional human antibody genes, while leaving other components of the mouse immune system unchanged. Such genetically engineered mice allow for the natural in vivo immune response and affinity maturation process which results in high affinity, full human monoclonal antibodies. This technology is well known in the art and is fully detailed in various publications, including but not limited to U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,545,806; 5,569,825; 5,625,126; 5,633,425; 5,789,650; 5,877,397; 5,661,016; 5,814,318; 5,874,299; 5,770,249 (assigned to GenPharm International and available through Medarex, under the umbrella of the \"UltraMab Human Antibody Development System\"); as well as U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,939,598; 6,075,181; 6,114,598; 6,150,584 and related family members (assigned to Abgenix, disclosing their XenoMouse.RTM. technology); the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. See also reviews from Kellerman and Green, 2002 Curr. Opinion in Biotechnology 13:593-597, and Kontermann & Stefan, 2001 Antibody Engineering, Springer Laboratory Manuals; the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.                Alternatively, a library of PCSK9-specific antagonists in accordance with the present invention may be brought into contact with PCSK9, and ones able to demonstrate specific binding selected. Functional studies can then be carried out to ensure proper functionality, e.g., inhibition of PCSK9-dependent inhibition of cellular LDL uptake. There are various techniques available to the skilled artisan for the selection of protein-specific molecules from libraries using enrichment technologies including, but not limited to, phage display (e.g., see technology from Cambridge Antibody Technology (\"CAT\") disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,565,332; 5,733,743; 5,871,907; 5,872,215; 5,885,793; 5,962,255; 6,140,471; 6,225,447; 6,291,650; 6,492,160; 6,521,404; 6,544,731; 6,555,313; 6,582,915; 6,593,081, as well as other U.S. family members and/or applications which rely on priority filing GB 9206318, filed May 24, 1992; see also Vaughn et al., 1996, Nature Biotechnology 14:309-314), ribosome display (see, e.g., Hanes and Pluckthun, 1997 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 94:4937-4942), bacterial display (see, e.g., Georgiou, et al., 1997 Nature Biotechnology 15:29-34) and/or yeast display (see, e.g., Kieke, et al., 1997 Protein Engineering 10:1303-1310); the preceding disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. A library, for example, can be displayed on the surface of bacteriophage particles, with nucleic acid encoding the PCSK9-specific antagonist or fragment thereof expressed and displayed on its surface. Nucleic acid may then be isolated from bacteriophage particles exhibiting the desired level of activity and the nucleic acid used in the development of desired antagonist. Phage display has been thoroughly described in the literature; see, e.g., Kontermann & Stefan, supra, and International Application Number WO 92/01047; the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. Specifically with regard to antibody molecules, individual heavy or light chain clones in accordance with the present invention may also be used to screen for complementary heavy or light chains, respectively, capable of interaction therewith to form a molecule of the combined heavy and light chains; see, e.g., International Application Number WO 92/01047. Any method of panning which is available to the skilled artisan may be used to identify PCSK9-specific antagonists. Another specific method for accomplishing this is to pan against the target antigen in solution, e.g. biotinylated, soluble PCSK9, and then capture the PCSK9-specific antagonist-phage complexes on streptavidin-coated magnetic beads, which are then washed to remove nonspecifically-bound phage. The captured phage can then be recovered from the beads in the same way they would be recovered from the surface of a plate, (e.g. DTT) as described herein.                PCSK9-specific antagonists may be purified by techniques available to one of skill in the art. Titers of the relevant antagonist preparation, ascites, hybridoma culture fluids, or relevant sample may be determined by various serological or immunological assays which include, but are not limited to, precipitation, passive agglutination, enzyme-linked immunosorbent antibody (\"ELISA\") techniques and radioimmunoassay (\"RIA\") techniques.                The present invention relates in part to methods employing PCSK9-specific antagonists described herein for antagonizing PCSK9 function; said methods of which are further described below. Use of the term \"antagonizing\" throughout the present application refers to the act of opposing, inhibiting, counteracting, neutralizing or curtailing one or more functions of PCSK9. Inhibition or antagonism of one or more of PCSK9-associated functional properties can be readily determined according to methodologies known to the art (see, e.g., Barak & Webb, 1981 J. Cell Biol. 90:595-604; Stephan & Yurachek, 1993 J. Lipid Res. 34:325330; and McNamara et al., 2006 Clinica Chimica Acta 369:158-167) as well as those described herein. Inhibition or antagonism will effectuate a decrease in PCSK9 activity relative to that seen in the absence of the antagonist or, for example, that seen when a control antagonist of irrelevant specificity is present. Preferably, a PCSK9-specific antagonist in accordance with the present invention antagonizes PCSK9 functioning to the point that there is a decrease of at least 10%, of the measured parameter including but not limited to the activities disclosed herein, and more preferably, a decrease of at least 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% and 95% of the measured parameter. Such inhibition/antagonism of PCSK9 functioning is particularly effective in those instances where PCSK9 functioning is contributing at least in part to a particular phenotype, disease, disorder or condition which is negatively impacting the subject.                In one aspect, the present invention provides a method for antagonizing the activity of PCSK9, which comprises contacting a cell, population of cells or tissue sample capable of being affected by PCSK9 (i.e., which expresses and/or comprises LDL receptors) with a PCSK9-specific antagonist disclosed herein under conditions that allow said antagonist to bind to PCSK9 when present and inhibit PCSK9's inhibition of cellular LDL uptake. Specific embodiments of the present invention include such methods wherein the cell is a human cell. Additional embodiments of the present invention include such methods wherein the cell is a murine cell.                In another aspect, the present invention provides a method for antagonizing the activity of PCSK9 in a subject, which comprises administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of a PCSK9-specific antagonist of the present invention. In specific embodiments, the methods for antagonizing PCSK9 function are for the treatment of a PCSK9-associated disease, disorder or condition or, alternatively, a disease, disorder or condition that could benefit from the effects of a PCSK9 antagonist. The medicament would be useful in a subject(s) exhibiting a condition associated with PCSK9 activity, or a condition where the functioning of PCSK9 is contraindicated for a particular subject. In select embodiments, the condition may be hypercholesterolemia, coronary heart disease, metabolic syndrome, acute coronary syndrome or related conditions.                The present invention, thus, contemplates the use of PCSK9-specific antagonists described herein in various methods of treatment where antagonizing PCSK9 function is desirable. The method of treatment can be prophylactic or therapeutic in nature. In specific embodiments, the present invention relates to a method of treatment for a condition associated with/attributed to PCSK9 activity, or a condition where the functioning of PCSK9 is contraindicated for a particular subject, which comprises administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of a PCSK9-specific antagonist of the present invention. In select embodiments, the condition may be hypercholesterolemia, coronary heart disease, metabolic syndrome, acute coronary syndrome or related conditions.                Methods of treatment in accordance with the present invention comprise administering to an individual a therapeutically (or prophylactically) effective amount of a PCSK9-specific antagonist of the present invention. Use of the terms \"therapeutically effective\" or \"prophylactically effective\" in reference to an amount refers to the amount necessary at the intended dosage to achieve the desired therapeutic/prophylactic effect for the period of time desired. The desired effect may be, for example, amelioration of at least one symptom associated with the treated condition. These amounts will vary, as the skilled artisan will appreciate, according to various factors, including but not limited to the disease state, age, sex and weight of the individual, and the ability of the PCSK9-specific antagonist to elicit the desired effect in the individual. The response may be documented by in vitro assay, in vivo non-human animal studies, and/or further supported from clinical trials.                The PCSK9-specific antagonist may be administered as a pharmaceutical composition. The present invention, thus, provides a pharmaceutically acceptable composition comprising a PCSK9-specific antagonist of the invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier including but not limited to an excipient, diluent, stabilizer, buffer, or alternative designed to facilitate administration of the antagonist in the desired format and amount to the treated individual.                The pharmaceutical composition may be formulated by any number of strategies known in the art, see, e.g., McGoff and Scher, 2000 Solution Formulation of Proteins/Peptides: In--McNally, E. J., ed. Protein Formulation and Delivery. New York, N.Y.: Marcel Dekker; pp. 139-158; Akers & Defilippis, 2000, Peptides and Proteins as Parenteral Solutions. In--Pharmaceutical Formulation Development of Peptides and Proteins. Philadelphia, Pa.: Taylor and Francis; pp. 145-177; Akers et al., 2002, Pharm. Biotechnol. 14:47-127. A pharmaceutically acceptable composition suitable for patient administration will contain an effective amount of the PCSK9-specific antagonist in a formulation which both retains biological activity while also promoting maximal stability during storage within an acceptable temperature range.                The antagonist-based pharmaceutically acceptable composition may, in particular embodiments, be in liquid or solid form, or in the form of gas particles or aerosolized particles. Any technique for production of liquid or solid formulations may be utilized. Such techniques are well within the realm of the abilities of the skilled artisan. Solid formulations may be produced by any available method including, but not limited to, lyophilization, spray drying, or drying by supercritical fluid technology. Solid formulations for oral administration may be in any form rendering the antagonist accessible to the patient in the prescribed amount and within the prescribed period of time. The oral formulation can take the form of a number of solid formulations including, but not limited to, a tablet, capsule, or powder. Solid formulations may alternatively be lyophilized and brought into solution prior to administration for either single or multiple dosing according to methods well known to the skilled artisan. Antagonist compositions should generally be formulated within a biologically relevant pH range and may be buffered to maintain a proper pH range during storage. Both liquid and solid formulations generally require storage at lower temperatures (e.g., 2-8.degree. C.) in order to retain stability for longer periods. Formulated antagonist compositions, especially liquid formulations, may contain a bacteriostat to prevent or minimize proteolysis during storage, including but not limited to effective concentrations (e.g., .ltoreq.1% w/v) of benzyl alcohol, phenol, m-cresol, chlorobutanol, methylparaben, and/or propylparaben. A bacteriostat may be contraindicated for some patients. Therefore, a lyophilized formulation may be reconstituted in a solution either containing or not containing such a component. Additional components may be added to either a buffered liquid or solid antagonist formulation, including but not limited to sugars as a cryoprotectant (including but not limited to polyhydroxy hydrocarbons such as sorbitol, mannitol, glycerol, and dulcitol and/or disaccharides such as sucrose, lactose, maltose, or trehalose) and, in some instances, a relevant salt (including but not limited to NaCl, KCl, or LiCl). Such antagonist formulations, especially liquid formulations slated for long term storage, will rely on a useful range of total osmolarity to both promote long term stability at temperatures of, for example, 2-8.degree. C. or higher, while also making the formulation useful for parenteral injection. As appropriate, preservatives, stabilizers, buffers, antioxidants and/or other additives may be included. The formulations may contain a divalent cation (including but not limited to MgCl2, CaCl2, and MnCl2); and/or a non-ionic surfactant (including but not limited to Polysorbate-80 (Tween 80.TM.), Polysorbate-60 (Tween 60.TM.), Polysorbate-40 (Tween 40.TM.), and Polysorbate-20 (Tween 20.TM.), polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers, including but not limited to Brij 58.TM., Brij35.TM., as well as others such as Triton X-100.TM., Triton X-114.TM., NP40.TM., Span 85 and the Pluronic series of non-ionic surfactants (e.g., Pluronic 121)). Any combination of such components form specific embodiments of the present invention.                Pharmaceutical compositions in liquid format may include a liquid carrier, e.g., water, petroleum, animal oil, vegetable oil, mineral oil, or synthetic oil. The liquid format may also include physiological saline solution, dextrose or other saccharide solution or glycols, such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol or polyethylene glycol.                Preferably, the pharmaceutical composition may be in the form of a parenterally acceptable aqueous solution that is pyrogen-free with suitable pH, tonicity, and stability. Pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated for administration after dilution in isotonic vehicles, for example, Sodium Chloride Injection, Ringer's Injection, or Lactated Ringer's Injection.                One aspect of the present invention is a pharmaceutical composition which comprises: (i) about 50 to about 200 mg/mL of a PCSK9-specific antagonist described herein; (ii) a polyhydroxy hydrocarbon (including but not limited to sorbitol, mannitol, glycerol and dulcitol) and/or a disaccharide (including but not limited to sucrose, lactose, maltose and trehalose); the total of said polyhydroxy hydrocarbon and/or disaccharide being about 1% to about 6% weight per volume (\"w/v\") of the formulation; (iii) about 5 mM to about 200 mM of histidine, imidazole, phosphate or acetic acid which serves as a buffering agent to prevent pH drift over the shelf life of the pharmaceutical composition and as a tonicity modifier; (iv) about 5 mM to about 200 mM of arginine, proline, phenylalanine, alanine, glycine, lysine, glutamic acid, aspartic acid or methionine to counteract aggregation; (v) about 0.01M to about 0.1M of hydrochloric acid (\"HCl\") in an amount sufficient to achieve a pH in the range of about 5.5 to about 7.5; and (vi) a liquid carrier including but not limited to sterile water, petroleum, animal oil, vegetable oil, mineral oil, synthetic oil, physiological saline solution, dextrose or other saccharide solution or glycols, such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol or polyethylene glycol; wherein said pharmaceutical composition has a pH in the range of about 5.5 to about 7.5; and wherein said pharmaceutical composition optionally comprises about 0.01% to about 1% w/v of the formulation of a non-ionic surfactant (including but not limited to Polysorbate-80 (Tween 80.TM.), Polysorbate-60 (Tween 60.TM.), Polysorbate-40 (Tween 40.TM.), and Polysorbate-20 (Tween 20.TM.), polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers, including but not limited to Brij 58.TM., Brij35.TM., as well as others such as Triton X-100.TM., Triton X-114.TM., NP40.TM., Span 85 and the Pluronic series of non-ionic surfactants (e.g., Pluronic 121)).                HCl may be added as free acid, Histidine-HCl or Arginine-HCl. Where supplied as Histidine-HCl or Arginine-HCl, the total amounts of Histidine or Arginine in the HCl form should be that specified above. Accordingly, some or all of the HCl depending on the amounts of Histidine and/or Arginine may be supplied as Histidine-HCl and/or Arginine-HCl; as appropriate. Use of the term \"about\" with respect to amounts disclosed in the specification means within 10% of the specified numbers provided. A range provided as, for example\" in \"about 50 to about 200\" expressly includes as distinct embodiments each number within said range. As such in the above example, embodiments including but not limited to those having 50, 100, 125, 150 and 200 form specific embodiments herein. Pharmaceutical compositions as disclosed herein have general applicability despite the mode of administration. In specific embodiments, the disclosed pharmaceutical compositions are useful for subcutaneous administration as a liquid or upon reconstitution of a lyophilized form. In specific embodiments, PCSK9-specific antagonists employed in the disclosed formulations may be pegylated or form part of fusion proteins.                Specific aspects of the present invention relate to the above disclosed pharmaceutical compositions which comprise: (i) about 50 to about 200 mg/mL of a PCSK9-specific antagonist described herein; (ii) about 1% to about 6% (in particular embodiments from about 2% to about 6%) w/v mannitol, trehalose or sucrose; (iii) about 10 mM to about 100 mM of histidine; (iv) about 25 mM to about 100 mM of arginine or proline; (v) about 0.02 M to about 0.05M of hydrochloric acid (\"HCl\") in an amount sufficient to achieve a pH in the range of about 5.8 to about 7; and (vi) a liquid carrier including but not limited to sterile water, petroleum, animal oil, vegetable oil, mineral oil, synthetic oil, physiological saline solution, dextrose or other saccharide solution or glycols, such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol or polyethylene glycol; wherein said pharmaceutical composition has a pH in the range of about 5.8 to about 7; and wherein said pharmaceutical composition optionally comprising about 0.01% to about 1% w/v of the formulation of a non-ionic surfactant (including but not limited to Polysorbate-80 (Tween 80.TM.), Polysorbate-60 (Tween 60.TM.), Polysorbate-40 (Tween 40.TM.), and Polysorbate-20 (Tween 20.TM.), polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers, including but not limited to Brij 58.TM., Brij35.TM., as well as others such as Triton X-100.TM., Triton X-114.TM., NP40.TM., Span 85 and the Pluronic series of non-ionic surfactants (e.g., Pluronic 121)).

Specific embodiments herein provide pharmaceutical compositions which comprise: (i) 50 to 200 mg/mL of a PCSK9-specific antagonist described herein; (ii) about 1% to about 6% (in particular embodiments from about 2% to about 6%) w/v sucrose; (iii) about 25 mM to about 100 mM of histidine; (iv) about 25 mM to about 100 mM of arginine; (v) about 0.040 M to about 0.045 M of hydrochloric acid (\"HCl\") in an amount sufficient to achieve a pH of about 6; and (vi) sterile water; wherein said pharmaceutical composition has a pH of about 6; and wherein said pharmaceutical composition optionally comprising about 0.01% to about 1% w/v of Polysorbate-80 (Tween 80.TM.) or Polysorbate-20 (Tween 20.TM.). In specific embodiments thereof, the levels of histidine and arginine are within 25 mM of each other and, in other embodiments are the same.                Specific embodiments herein provide pharmaceutical compositions which comprise (i) 50 to 200 mg/mL of a PCSK9-specific antagonist described herein; (ii) sucrose, histidine and arginine in one of the following amounts: (a) about 1% w/v sucrose, about 10 mM histidine and about 25 mM arginine; (b) about 2% w/v sucrose, about 25 mM histidine and about 25 mM arginine; (c) about 3% w/v sucrose, about 50 mM histidine and about 50 mM arginine; or (d) about 6% w/v sucrose, about 100 mM histidine and about 100 mM arginine; (iii) about 0.04 mol or, alternatively, about 1.46 g of HCl; and (iv) sterile water; wherein said pharmaceutical composition has a pH of about 6; and wherein said pharmaceutical composition optionally comprising about 0.01% to about 1% w/v of Polysorbate-80 (Tween 80.TM.) or Polysorbate-20 (Tween 20.TM.). Specific embodiments herein are wherein the amounts of sucrose, histidine and arginine in (ii) above are that described in (c) or (d).                Specific embodiments herein provide pharmaceutical compositions as described which comprise 50 to 200 mg/ml of any one of the various PCSK9-specific antagonists described herein. For purposes of exemplification of one distinct embodiment thereof, and not to be construed as a limitation, is the following: a pharmaceutical formulation as described above which comprises: a PCSK9-specific antagonist which comprises: (a) a light chain comprising SEQ ID NO: 26; and (b) a heavy chain comprising SEQ ID NO: 25; wherein said PCSK9-specific antagonist is an antibody molecule that antagonizes PCSK9's inhibition of cellular LDL uptake.                Particular embodiments herein are pharmaceutical compositions according to the above description which are lyophilized and reconstituted. In specific embodiments, said protein concentration in said lyophilized and reconstituted solution is up to 2-fold higher than in the pre-lyophilized composition. In specific embodiments, the protein or PCSK9-specific antagonist concentration in the lyophilized and/or reconstituted pharmaceutical composition is in the range of about 50 mg/mL to about 300 mg/mL. Diluents useful for reconstituting the lyophilized pharmaceutical compositions include but are not limited to sterile water, bacteriostatic water for injection (\"BWFI\"), phosphate-buffered saline, a sterile saline solution, physiological saline solution, Ringer's solution or dextrose solution and may in specific embodiments contain 0.01-1% (w/v) of Polysorbate-80 (Tween 80.TM.) or Polysorbate-20 (Tween 20.TM.). In specific embodiments, lyophilized powder can be reconstituted with 1/60.2.times. original volume (or 0.167 mL) up to 1.times. (1 mL).                Exemplary embodiments of the present invention are pharmaceutical compositions as described herein which are stable. Other embodiments of the present invention are pharmaceutical compositions as described herein which are stable to lyophilization and reconstitution. Various methods are available to the skilled artisan to prepare lyophilized compositions; see, e.g., Martin & Mo, 2007 \"Stability Considerations for Lyophilized Biologics\" Amer. Pharm. Rev. \"Stable\" as used herein refers to the property of the protein or PCSK9-specific antagonist to retain its physical or chemical stability, conformational integrity, or its ability to exhibit less denaturation, protein clipping, aggregation, fragmentation, acidic variant formation or loss of biological activity compared with a control sample at a temperature in the range of 4-37.degree. C. for at least about 30 days. Other embodiments remain stable for up to 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 2 years or longer periods at the above temperatures. In specific embodiments the formulation exhibits no significant changes at 2-8.degree. C. for at least 6 months, and preferably 12 months, 2 years or longer, in order of preference. Specific embodiments experience less than 10% or, in particular embodiments, less than 5% of denaturation, protein clipping, aggregation, fragmentation, acidic variant formation or loss of biological activity compared with a control sample at a temperature in the range of 25-45.degree. C. (or alternatively 2-8.degree. C.) for at least about 30 days, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 2 years or longer. Stability of the formulations can be tested via several means known to the skilled artisan including, but not limited to Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC-HPLC) to measure aggregation and fragmentation, Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) to measure particle size of concentrated samples, capillary SDS-PAGE to measure fragmentation and capillary iso-electric focusing (cIEF) or cation exchange chromatography (\"CEX\") to measure acidic variants formation. Techniques suitable for the analysis of protein stability are well understood by those of skill in the art: see review in Peptide and Protein Drug Delivery, 247-301, Vincent Lee Ed., Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., Pubs. (1991) and Jones, 1993 Adv. Drug Delivery Rev. 10:29-90.                Pharmaceutical compositions as described herein should be sterile. There are various techniques available to the skilled artisan to accomplish this including, but not limited to, filtration through sterile filtration membranes. In specific embodiments, employing lyophilized and reconstituted compositions, this may be done prior to or following lyophilization and reconstitution.                Dosing of antagonist therapeutics is well within the realm of the skilled artisan, see, e.g., Lederman et al., 1991 Int. J. Cancer 47:659-664; Bagshawe et al., 1991 Antibody, Immunoconjugates and Radiopharmaceuticals 4:915-922, and will vary based on a number of factors including but not limited to the particular PCSK9-specific antagonist utilized, the patient being treated, the condition of the patient, the area being treated, the route of administration, and the treatment desired. A physician or veterinarian of ordinary skill can readily determine and prescribe the effective therapeutic amount of the antagonist. Dosage ranges may be from about 0.01 to 100 mg/kg, and more usually 0.05 to 25 mg/kg, of the host body weight. For example, dosages can be 0.3 mg/kg body weight, 1 mg/kg body weight, 3 mg/kg body weight, 5 mg/kg body weight or 10 mg/kg body weight or within the range of 1-10 mg/kg. For purposes of illustration, and not limitation, in specific embodiments, a dose of 5 mg to 2.0 g may be utilized to deliver the antagonist systemically. Optimal precision in achieving concentrations of antagonist within a range that yields efficacy without toxicity requires a regimen based on the kinetics of the drug's availability to the target site(s). This involves a consideration of the distribution, equilibrium, and elimination of the PCSK9-specific antagonist. Antagonists described herein may be used alone at appropriate dosages. Alternatively, co-administration or sequential administration of other agents may be desirable. It will be possible to present a therapeutic dosing regime for the PCSK9-specific antagonists of the present invention in conjunction with alternative treatment regimes. For example, PCSK9-specific antagonists may be used in combination or in conjunction with other drugs (therapeutic and/or prophylactic), including but not limited to cholesterol-lowering drugs, for example, cholesterol absorption inhibitors (e.g., Zetia.RTM.) and cholesterol synthesis inhibitors (e.g., Zocor.RTM. and Vytorin.RTM.). The present invention contemplates such combinations and they form an important embodiment hereof. Accordingly, the present invention relates to methods of treatment as described above where the PCSK9-specific antagonist is administered/delivered simultaneously with, following or prior to another drug or drugs (therapeutic and/or prophylactic), including but not limited to cholesterol-lowering drugs, cholesterol absorption inhibitors and cholesterol absorption inhibitors.                Individuals (subjects) capable of treatment as described herein include primates, human and non-human, and include any non-human mammal or vertebrate of commercial or domestic veterinary importance.                The PCSK9-specific antagonist may be administered to an individual by any route of administration appreciated in the art, including but not limited to oral administration, administration by injection (specific embodiments of which include intravenous, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal or intramuscular injection), administration by inhalation, intranasal, or topical administration, either alone or in combination with other agents designed to assist in the treatment of the individual. The PCSK9-specific antagonist may also be administered by injection devices, injector pens, needleless devices; and subcutaneous patch delivery systems. The route of administration should be determined based on a number of considerations appreciated by the skilled artisan including, but not limited to, the desired physiochemical characteristics of the treatment. Treatment may be provided on a daily, weekly, biweekly, or monthly basis, or any other regimen that delivers the appropriate amount of PCSK9-specific antagonist to the individual at the prescribed times such that the desired treatment is effected and maintained. The formulations may be administered in a single dose or in more than one dose at separate times.                Also contemplated are methods of using the disclosed antagonists in the manufacture of a medicament for treatment of a PCSK9-associated disease, disorder or condition or, alternatively, a disease, disorder or condition that could benefit from the effects of a PCSK9 antagonist. The medicament would be useful in a subject(s) exhibiting a condition associated with PCSK9 activity, or a condition where the functioning of PCSK9 is contraindicated for a particular subject. In select embodiments, the condition may be hypercholesterolemia, coronary heart disease, metabolic syndrome, acute coronary syndrome or related conditions.                PCSK9-specific antagonists disclosed herein may also be used as a method of diagnosis of PCSK9. In select embodiments, the present invention encompasses methods of identifying or quantifying the level of PCSK9 present in a sample (including but not limited to a biological sample, e.g., serum or blood) which comprises contacting the sample with a PCSK9-specific antagonist described herein and detecting or quantifying, respectively, binding to PCSK9. The PCSK9-specific antagonist may be used in various assay formats known to the skilled artisan and may form part of a kit (the general features of a kit of which are further described below).                The present invention further provides for the administration of disclosed anti-PCSK9 antagonists for purposes of gene therapy. Through such methods, cells of a subject are transformed with nucleic acid encoding a PCSK9-specific antagonist of the invention. Subjects comprising the nucleic acids then produce the PCSK9-specific antagonists endogenously. Previously, Alvarez, et al, Clinical Cancer Research 6:3081-3087, 2000, introduced single-chain anti-ErbB2 antibodies to subjects using a gene therapy approach. The methods disclosed by Alvarez, et al, supra, may be easily adapted for the introduction of nucleic acids encoding an anti-PCSK9 antibody of the invention to a subject.                Nucleic acids encoding any PCSK9-specific antagonist may be introduced to a subject.                The nucleic acids may be introduced to the cells of a subject by any means known in the art. In preferred embodiments, the nucleic acids are introduced as part of a viral vector. Examples of preferred viruses from which the vectors may be derived include lentiviruses, herpes viruses, adenoviruses, adeno-associated viruses, vaccinia virus, baculovirus, alphavirus, influenza virus, and other recombinant viruses with desirable cellular tropism.                Various companies produce viral vectors commercially, including, but by no means limited to, Avigen, Inc. (Alameda, Calif.; AAV vectors), Cell Genesys (Foster City, Calif.; retroviral, adenoviral, AAV vectors, and lentiviral vectors), Clontech (retroviral and baculoviral vectors), Genovo, Inc. (Sharon Hill, Pa.; adenoviral and AAV vectors), Genvec (adenoviral vectors), IntroGene (Leiden, Netherlands; adenoviral vectors), Molecular Medicine (retroviral, adenoviral, AAV, and herpes viral vectors), Norgen (adenoviral vectors), Oxford BioMedica (Oxford, United Kingdom; lentiviral vectors), and Transgene (Strasbourg, France; adenoviral, vaccinia, retroviral, and lentiviral vectors).                Methods for constructing and using viral vectors are known in the art (see, e.g., Miller, et al, BioTechniques 7:980-990, 1992). Preferably, the viral vectors are replication defective, that is, they are unable to replicate autonomously, and thus are not infectious, in the target cell. Preferably, the replication defective virus is a minimal virus, i.e., it retains only the sequences of its genome which are necessary for encapsidating the genome to produce viral particles. Defective viruses, which entirely or almost entirely lack viral genes, are preferred. Use of defective viral vectors allows for administration to cells in a specific, localized area, without concern that the vector can infect other cells. Thus, a specific tissue can be specifically targeted.                Examples of vectors comprising attenuated or defective DNA virus sequences include, but are not limited to, a defective herpes virus vector (Kanno et al, Cancer Gen. Ther. 6:147-154, 1999; Kaplitt et al, J. Neurosci. Meth. 71:125-132, 1997 and Kaplitt et al, J. Neuro Onc. 19:137-147, 1994).                Adenoviruses are eukaryotic DNA viruses that can be modified to efficiently deliver a nucleic acid of the invention to a variety of cell types. Attenuated adenovirus vectors, such as the vector described by Strafford-Perricaudet et al, J. Clin. Invest. 90:626-630, 1992 are desirable in some instances. Various replication defective adenovirus and minimum adenovirus vectors have been described (PCT Publication Nos. WO94/26914, WO94/28938, WO94/28152, WO94/12649, WO95/02697 and WO96/22378). The replication defective recombinant adenoviruses according to the invention can be prepared by any technique known to a person skilled in the art (Levrero et al, Gene 101:195, 1991; EP 185573; Graham, EMBO J. 3:2917, 1984; Graham et al, J. Gen. Virol. 36:59, 1977).                The adeno-associated viruses (AAV) are DNA viruses of relatively small size which can integrate, in a stable and site-specific manner, into the genome of the cells which they infect. They are able to infect a wide spectrum of cells without inducing any effects on cellular growth, morphology or differentiation, and they do not appear to be involved in human pathologies. The use of vectors derived from the AAVs for transferring genes in vitro and in vivo has been described (see Daly, et al, Gene Ther. 8:1343-1346, 2001, Larson et al, Adv. Exp. Med. Bio. 489:45-57, 2001; PCT Publication Nos. WO 91/18088 and WO 93/09239; U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,797,368 and 5,139,941 and EP 488528B1).                In another embodiment, the gene can be introduced in a retroviral vector, e.g., as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,399,346, 4,650,764, 4,980,289, and 5,124,263; Mann et al, Cell 33:153, 1983; Markowitz et al, J. Virol., 62:1120, 1988; EP 453242 and EP178220. The retroviruses are integrating viruses which infect dividing cells.                Lentiviral vectors can be used as agents for the direct delivery and sustained expression of nucleic acids encoding a PCSK9-specific antagonist of the invention in several tissue types, including brain, retina, muscle, liver and blood. The vectors can efficiently transduce dividing and nondividing cells in these tissues, and maintain long-term expression of the PCSK9-specific antagonist. For a review, see Zufferey et al, J. Virol. 72:9873-80, 1998 and Kafri et al, Curr. Opin. Mol. Ther. 3:316-326, 2001. Lentiviral packaging cell lines are available and known generally in the art. They facilitate the production of high-titer lentivirus vectors for gene therapy. An example is a tetracycline-inducible VSV-G pseudotyped lentivirus packaging cell line which can generate virus particles at titers greater than 10.sup.6 IU/ml for at least 3 to 4 days; see Kafri et al, J. Virol. 73:576-584, 1999. The vector produced by the inducible cell line can be concentrated as needed for efficiently transducing nondividing cells in vitro and in vivo.                Sindbis virus is a member of the alphavirus genus and has been studied extensively since its discovery in various parts of the world beginning in 1953. Gene transduction based on alphavirus, particularly Sindbis virus, has been well-studied in vitro (see Straus et al, Microbiol. Rev., 58:491-562, 1994; Bredenbeek et al, J. Virol., 67:6439-6446, 1993; Ijima et al, Int. J. Cancer 80:110-118, 1999 and Sawai et al, Biochim. Biophyr. Res. Comm. 248:315-323, 1998. Many properties of alphavirus vectors make them a desirable alternative to other virus-derived vector systems being developed, including rapid engineering of expression constructs, production of high-titered stocks of infectious particles, infection of nondividing cells, and high levels of expression (Strauss et al, 1994 supra). Use of Sindbis virus for gene therapy has been described. (Wahlfors et al, Gene. Ther. 7:472-480, 2000 and Lundstrom, J. Recep. Sig. Transduct. Res. 19(1-4):673-686, 1999.                In another embodiment, a vector can be introduced to cells by lipofection or with other transfection facilitating agents (peptides, polymers, etc.). Synthetic cationic lipids can be used to prepare liposomes for in vivo and in vitro transfection of a gene encoding a marker (Feigner et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84:7413-7417, 1987 and Wang et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84:7851-7855, 1987). Useful lipid compounds and compositions for transfer of nucleic acids are described in PCT Publication Nos. WO 95/18863 and WO 96/17823, and in U.S. Pat. No. 5,459,127.                It is also possible to introduce the vector in vivo as a naked DNA plasmid. Naked DNA vectors for gene therapy can be introduced into desired host cells by methods known in the art, e.g., electroporation, microinjection, cell fusion, DEAE dextran, calcium phosphate precipitation, use of a gene gun, or use of a DNA vector transporter (see, e.g., Wilson, et al, J. Biol. Chem. 267:963-967, 1992; Williams et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88:2726-2730, 1991). Other reagents commonly used for transfection of plasmids include, but are by no means limited to, FuGene, Lipofectin, and Lipofectamine. Receptor-mediated DNA delivery approaches can also be used (Wu et al, J. Biol. Chem. 263:14621-14624, 1988). U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,580,859 and 5,589,466 disclose delivery of exogenous DNA sequences, free of transfection facilitating agents, in a mammal. Recently, a relatively low voltage, high efficiency in vivo DNA transfer technique, termed electrotransfer, has been described (Vilquin et al, Gene Ther. 8:1097, 2001; Payen et al, Exp. Hematol. 29:295-300, 2001; Mir, Bioelectrochemistry 53:1-10, 2001; PCT Publication Nos. WO 99/01157, WO 99/01158 and WO 99/01175).                Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for such gene therapy approaches and comprising nucleic acids encoding an anti-PCSK9 antagonist of the present invention are included within the scope of the present invention.                In another aspect, the present invention provides a method for identifying, isolating, quantifying or antagonizing PCSK9 in a sample of interest using a PCSK9-specific antagonist of the present invention. The PCSK9-specific antagonists may be utilized as research tools in immunochemical assays, such as Western blots, ELISAs, radioimmunoassay, immunohistochemical assays, immunoprecipitations, or other immunochemical assays known in the art (see, e.g., Immunological Techniques Laboratory Manual, ed. Goers, J. 1993, Academic Press) or various purification protocols. The antagonists may have a label incorporated therein or affixed thereto to facilitate ready identification or measurement of the activities associated therewith. One skilled in the art is readily familiar with the various types of detectable labels (e.g., enzymes, dyes, or other suitable molecules which are either readily detectable or cause some activity/result that is readily detectable) which are or may be useful in the above protocols.                An additional aspect of the present invention are kits comprising PCSK9-specific antagonists or pharmaceutical compositions disclosed herein and instructions for use. Kits typically but need not include a label indicating the intended use of the contents of the kit. The term label includes any writing, or recorded material supplied on or with the kit, or which otherwise accompanies the kit. In specific embodiments wherein the pharmaceutical composition is provided lyophilized, the kit may include sterile water or saline for reconstitution of the formulation into liquid form. In specific embodiments, the amount of water or saline is from about 0.1 ml to 1.0 ml.                The following examples are provided to illustrate the present invention without limiting the same hereto:                EXAMPLE 1                Isolation of Recombinant Fab Display Phage                Recombinant Morphosys HuCAL Gold Fab phage display libraries (see, e.g., Knappik et al., 2000 J. Mol. Biol. 296:57-86) were panned against immobilized recombinant murine PCSK9 through a process which is briefly described as follows: Phage Fab display libraries were first divided into 3 pools: one pool of VH2+VH4+VH5, another of VH1+VH6, and a third pool of VH3. The phage pools and immobilized PCSK9 protein were blocked with nonfat dry milk.                For the first round of panning, each phage pool was bound independently to V5-, His-tagged PCSK9 protein immobilized in wells of Nunc Maxisorp plate. Immobilized phage-PCSK9 complexes were washed sequentially with (1) PBS/0.5% Tween.TM. 20 (Three quick washes); (2) PBS/0.5% Tween.TM. 20 (One 5 min. incubation with mild shaking); (3) PBS (Three quick washes); and (4) PBS (Two 5-min. incubations with mild shaking). Bound phages were eluted with 20 mM DTT and all three eluted phage suspensions were combined into one tube. E. coli TG1 were infected with eluted phages. Pooled culture of phagemid-bearing cells (chloramphenicol-resistant) were grown up, and frozen stock of phagemid-bearing culture were made. Phage were rescued from culture by co-infection with helper phage, and phage stock for next round of panning were made.                For the second round of panning, phages from Round 1 were bound to immobilized, blocked V5-, His-tagged PCSK9 protein. Immobilized phage-PCSK9 complexes were washed sequentially with (1) PBS/0.05% Tween.TM. 20 (One quick wash); (2) PBS/0.05% Tween.TM. 20 (Four 5 min. incubations with mild shaking); (3) PBS (One quick wash); and (4) PBS (Four 5-min. incubations with mild shaking). Bound phages were eluted, E. coli TG1 cells were infected, and phage were rescued as in Round 1.                For the third round of panning, phages from Round 2 were bound to immobilized, blocked V5-His-tagged PCSK9 protein. Immobilized phage-PCSK9 complexes were washed sequentially with (1) PBS/0.05% Tween.TM. 20 (Ten quick washes); (2) PBS/0.05% Tween.TM. 20 (Five 5 min. incubations with mild shaking); (3) PBS (Ten quick washes); and (4) PBS (Five 5-min. incubations with mild shaking). Bound phages were eluted and E. coli TG1 cells were infected as in Round 1. Phagemid-infected cells were grown overnight and phagemid DNA was prepared.                XbaI-EcoRI inserts from Round 3 phagemid DNA were subcloned into Morphosys Fab expression vector pMORPH_x9_MH to yield plasmid pMORPHx9 MH/mPCSK9 2 CX1 D05 (see, e.g., FIG. 1), and a library of Fab expression clones was generated in E. coli TG1 F-. Transformants were spread on LB+chloramphenicol+glucose plates and grown overnight to generate bacterial colonies. Individual transformant colonies were picked and placed into wells of two 96-well plates for growth and screening for Fab expression.                EXAMPLE 2                ELISA Screening of Bacterially Expressed Fabs                Cultures of individual transformants were IPTG-induced and grown overnight for Fab expression. Culture supernatants (candidate Fabs) were incubated with purified V5-, His-tagged PCSK9 protein immobilized in wells of 96-well Nunc Maxisorp plates, washed with 0.1% Tween.TM. 20 in PBS using a plate washer, incubated with HRP-coupled anti-Fab antibody, and washed again with PBS/Tween.TM. 20. Bound HRP was detected by addition of TMP substrate, and A.sub.450 values of wells were read with a plate reader.                Negative controls were included as follows: Controls for nonspecific Fab binding on each plate were incubated with parallel expressed preparations of anti-EsB, an irrelevant Fab. Growth medium only.                Positive controls for ELISA and Fab expression were included as follows: EsB antigen was bound to three wells of the plate and subsequently incubated with anti-EsB Fab. To control for Fabs reacting with the V5 or His tags of the recombinant PCSK9 antigen, parallel ELISAs were performed using V5-, His-tagged secreted alkaline phosphatase protein (SEAP) expressed in the same cells as the original PCSK9 antigen and similarly purified. Putative PCSK9-reactive Fabs were identified as yielding >3.times. background values when incubated with PCSK9 antigen but negative when incubated with SEAP. Clones scoring as PCSK9-reactive in the first round of screening were consolidated onto a single plate, re-grown in triplicate, re-induced with IPTG, and re-assayed in parallel ELISAs vs. PCSK9 and SEAP. Positive and negative controls were included as described above. Clones scoring positive in at least 2 of 3 replicates were carried forward into subsequent characterizations. In cases of known or suspected mixed preliminary clones, cultures were re-purified by streaking for single colonies on 2xYT plates with chloramphenicol, and liquid cultures from three or more separate colonies were assayed again by ELISAs in triplicate as described above.                EXAMPLE 3                DNA Sequence Determination of PCSK9 ELISA-Positive Fab Clones                Bacterial culture for DNA preps was made by inoculating 1.2 ml 2xYT liquid media with chloramphenicol from master glycerol stocks of positive Fabs, and growing overnight. DNA was prepared from cell pellets centrifuged out of the overnight cultures using the Qiagen Turbo Mini preps performed on a BioRobot 9600. ABI Dye Terminator cycle sequencing was performed on the DNA with Morphosys defined sequencing primers and run on an ABI 3100 Genetic Analyzer, to obtain the DNA sequence of the Fab clones. DNA sequences were compared to each other to determine unique clone sequences and to determine light and heavy chain subtypes of the Fab clones.                EXAMPLE 4                Expression and Purification of Fabs from Unique PCSK9 ELISA-Positive Clone                Fabs from ELISA-positive clone m2CX1D05 and the EsB (negative control) Fab were expressed by IPTG-induction in E. coli TG1F- cells. Cultures were lysed and the His-tagged Fabs were purified by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC), and proteins were exchanged into 25 mM HEPES pH 7.3/150 mM NaCl by centrifugal diafiltration. Proteins were analyzed by electrophoresis on Caliper Lab-Chip 90 and by conventional SDS-PAGE, and quantified by Bradford protein assay. Purified Fab protein was re-assayed by ELISA in serial dilutions to confirm activity of purified Fab. Positive and Negative controls were run as before. Purified Fab preparations were then analyzed as described below.                EXAMPLE 5                Conversion of m2CX1D05 Fab to Full Length IgG                The DNA sequence encoding the m2CX1D05 light chain variable region was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from plasmid template pMORPHx9_MH/mPCSK9.sub.--2_CX1_D05, using primers: ACAGATGCCAGATGCGATATCCAGATGACCCAGA (SEQ ID NO: 33) and TGCAGCCACCGTACGTTTAATTTCAACTTTCGTACC (SEQ ID NO: 34). The product of this amplification was cloned into plasmid pV1JNSA-GS-FB-LCK that had been previously digested with FspI and BmtI, using the InFusion cloning system (Clontech). The resulting plasmid was verified by DNA sequencing across the variable region. Endotoxin-free plasmid preparations were made using the Qiagen Endo-Free plasmid maxiprep kit.                The DNA sequence encoding the heavy chain variable region of pMORPHx9_MH/mPCSK9.sub.--2_CX1_D05 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using primers: ACAGGTGTCCACTCGCAGGTGCAATTGGTTCAGTCT (SEQ ID NO: 35) and GCCCTTGGTGGATGCTGAGCTAACCGTCACCAGGGT (SEQ ID NO: 36), and the amplified product was cloned into plasmid pV1 JNSA-BF-HCG2M4 that had been previously digested with FspI and BmtI. The resulting plasmid was verified by DNA sequencing across the variable region. Endotoxin-free plasmid preparations were made using the Qiagen Endo-Free plasmid maxiprep kit.                Full-length IgG was obtained by co-transfection of HEK293 cells with the 1D05 light chain- and heavy-chain-encoding plasmids, following by Protein A purification of the expressed IgG.                EXAMPLE 6                Kinetic Evaluation of FAB:PCSK9 Interactions with Surface Plasmon Resonance (\"SPR\")                SPR measurements were performed using a Biacore.TM. (Pharmacia Biosensor AB, Uppsala, Sweden) 2000 system. Sensor chip CM5 and Amine Coupling Kit for immobilization were from Biacore.TM..                Anti-Fab IgG (Human specific) (Sigma, catalog #15260) was covalently coupled to surfaces 1 and 2 of a Sensor Chip CM5 via primary amine groups, using the immobilization wizard with the \"Aim for immobilization\" option using Biacore.TM. Amine Coupling Kit (cat# BR-1000-50. A target immobilization of 5000 RU was specified. The wizard uses a 7 minute activation with a 1:1 mixture of 100 mM NHS (N-Hydroxysuccinimide) and 400 mM EDC (1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide), injects the ligand in several pulses to achieve the desired level, then deactivates the remaining surface with a 7 minute pulse of ethanolamine.                Anti-PCSK9 Fabs were captured on capture surface 2, and surface 1 was used as a reference for kinetic studies of Fab:PCSK9 interactions. Each Fab was captured by flowing a 500 ng/ml solution at 5 or 10 .mu.l/min for 1-1.5 minutes to reach a target R.sub.L for an R.sub.max of 100-150 RU for the reaction. 5-10 concentrations of hPCSK9v5His or mPCSK9v5His antigens were flowed across the surface at 30 .mu.l/minute for 3-4 minutes. 15-60 minutes dissociation time was allowed before regeneration of the Anti-Fab surface with a 30 second pulse of 10 mM glycine pH 2.0.                BiaEvaluation Software was used to evaluate the sensograms from the multiple concentration of PCSK9 antigen analyzed with each Fab, to estimate the kinetics constants of the Fab:PCSK9 interactions.                The kinetic constants were determined as follows:                TABLE-US-00002 TABLE 2 Fab Antigen k.sub.on (1/Ms .times. 10.sup.-5) k.sub.off (1/s .times. l0.sup.4) K.sub.D (nM) m2CX1D05 Human 0.22 .+-. 0.01 2.47 .+-. 0.05 11.5 .+-. 0.75 Fab PCSK9 mean (N = 3) m2CX1D05 Murine 0.86 .+-. 0.02 2.57 .+-. 0.19 3.35 .+-. 0.39 Fab PCSK9 mean (N = 3)                EXAMPLE 7                Kinetic Evaluation OF IgG:PCSK9 Interactions with Surface Plasmon Resonance (\"SPR\")                SPR measurements were performed using a Biacore.TM. (Pharmacia Biosensor AB, Uppsala, Sweden) 2000 system. Sensor chip CM5 and Amine Coupling Kit for immobilization were from Biacore.TM..                A goat Anti-Human IgG (Caltag, catalog #H10700) was covalently coupled to surfaces 1 and 2 of a Sensor Chip CM5 via primary amine groups, using the immobilization wizard with the \"Aim for immobilization\" option using Biacore.TM. Amine Coupling Kit (cat# BR-1000-50. A target immobilization of 5000 RU was specified.

Anti-PCSK9 IgGs were captured on capture surface 2, and surface 1 was used as a reference for kinetic studies of IgG:PCSK9 interactions. IgG was captured by flowing a 10 nM solution at 10 .mu.l/min for 1-1.5 minutes to reach a target R.sub.L for an R.sub.max of 100-150 RU for the reaction. 5-10 concentrations of hPCSK9v5His or mPCSK9v5His antigens were flowed across the surface at 30 or 60 .mu.l/minute for 4 minutes. 15-60 minutes dissociation time was allowed before regeneration of the Anti-IgG surface with a 60 second pulse of 10 mM Glycine pH 1.7.                BiaEvaluation Software was used to evaluate the sensograms from the multiple concentration of PCSK9 antigen analyzed with each IgG, to estimate the kinetics constants of the IgG:PCSK9 interactions.

Biol. Chem. 282:20502-20512. AlexaFluor647-labeled PCSK9 (final concentration 10 nM) was combined with varying amounts of 1D05 and to this was added Eu(8044)-labeled LDLR ectodomain to a final concentration of .about.1.5 nM (sufficient to give 20,000 counts at F1620 nM on the Rubystar) in 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM CaCl.sub.2, 0.05% (w/v) BSA in a total volume of 50 .mu.L using 96 well black Dynatech U bottom plates. After at least 90 minutes of equilibration, samples were read in a Rubystar reader (BMG Corp.) using 20 flashes per well, a 50 usec integration delay, and a 200 usec total integration time. Data were expressed as the ratio of (Fl.sub.665/Fl.sub.620.times.10000) and an IC.sub.50 for 1D05 was determined from the inflection point of a sigmoidal dose-response curve using a standard four parameter fit.                FIG. 2 illustrates the activity of 1D05 in the PCSK9-LDLR interaction TR-FRET assay. Both the Fab and IgG of 1D05 are potent and inhibit the PCSK9-LDLR interaction fully.                EXAMPLE 9                Exopolar Assay                Effects of Exogenous PCSK90N Cellular LDL Uptake                On day 1, 30,000 HEK cells/well were plated in a 96 well polyD-lysine coated plate. On day 2, the media was switched to no-serum containing DMEM media. On day 3, the media was removed and the cells were washed with OptiMEM. Purified PCSK9 was added in 100 .mu.l of DMEM media containing LPDS and dI-LDL. The plates were incubated at 37.degree. C. for 6.5 hrs. The cells were washed quickly in TBS containing 2 mg/ml BSA; then washed in TBS-BSA for 2 minutes; and then washed twice (but quickly) with TBS. The cells were lysed in 100 .mu.l RIPA buffer. Fluorescence was then measured in the plate using an Ex 520, Em 580 nm. The total cellular protein in each well was measured using a BCA Protein Assay and the fluorescence units were then normalized to total protein.                The Exopolar Assay is effective for characterizing variant effects on LDL uptake; see Table 4 below illustrating how the potencies of PCSK9 mutants correlate with plasma LDL-cholesterol in the Exopolar Assay.                TABLE-US-00004 TABLE 4 EC-50 (nM) Mutation Gain/Loss LDL-C (mg/dI) Exopolar S127R Gain 277 14 D374Y Gain 388 1.3 Wild-type 140 51 R46L Loss 116 78                Results: m2CX1D05, both Fab and IgG, dose-dependently inhibited the effects of both human and murine PCSK9 on LDL uptake; an effect which was reproducibly observed. The amount of PCSK9 added to the cells was .about.100-320 nM.                m2CX1D05 (Fab) comprises a light chain of SEQ ID NO: 1 (comprising a VL of SEQ ID NO: 27) and a Fd chain of SEQ ID NO: 9 inclusive of linkers and tags (comprising a VH of SEQ ID NO: 11).                M2CX1D05 (IgG) comprises a light chain of SEQ ID NO: 26, and a heavy chain comprising SEQ ID NO: 25.                FIGS. 3A-3D illustrate (i) 1D05 (Fab)'s dose-dependent inhibition of murine PCSK9-dependent loss of cellular LDL-uptake (FIG. 3A); (ii) 1D05 (IgG)'s dose-dependent inhibition of murine PCSK9-dependent loss of cellular LDL-uptake (FIG. 3B); (iii) 1D05 (Fab)'s dose-dependent inhibition of human PCSK9-dependent loss of cellular LDL-uptake (FIG. 3C); and (iv) 1D05 (IgG)'s dose-dependent inhibition of human PSCK9-dependent loss of cellular LDL-uptake (FIG. 3D).                1D05 clearly cross reacts with both human and mouse PCSK9.                FIGS. 3A-3D have two controls: (i) a cell only control, showing the basal level of cellular LDL uptake, and (ii) a cell+PCSK9 (5 .mu.g/ml) control which shows the level of PCSK9-dependent loss of LDL-uptake. The titration experiments which contain 1D05 and PCSK9 were done at a fixed concentration of PCSK9 (5 .mu.g/ml) and increasing concentrations of 1D05 shown in the graphs.                1D05 can inhibit the effect of PCSK9 on cellular LDL uptake. IC.sub.50s for 1D05 (Fab) are 97 and 144 nM for mouse and human PCSK9 protein, respectively. IC.sub.50s for 1D05 (IgG) are 85 and 79 nM for mouse and human PCSK9 protein, respectively.                EXAMPLE 10                PCSK9 Cellular Uptake                The assay that follows was carried out according to the methods of Fisher et al., 2007 J. Biol. Chem. 282: 20502-12.                Cells treated with Alexa Fluor 647-labeled PCSK9 were imaged as follows. CHO cells were plated on poly-D-lysine-coated 96-well optical CVG sterile black plates (Nunc) at a density of 20,000 cells/well. Cells were plated in F-12K medium (nutrient mixture, Kaighn's modification (1.times.)) (Invitrogen) containing 100 units of penicillin and 100 .mu.g/ml streptomycin sulfate and supplemented with 10% FBS. Plates were incubated overnight at 37.degree. C. and 5% CO.sub.2. The following morning, the medium was removed and replaced with 100 .mu.l of F-12K medium containing 100 units of penicillin and 100 .mu.g/ml streptomycin sulfate. After 18 h, the medium was removed. Purified PCSK9 protein was labeled with Alexa Fluor 647 as described under \"Experimental Procedures.\" Alexa Fluor 647-labeled PCSK9 (1, 5, or 20 .mu.g/ml) was added in 50 .mu.l of F-12K medium containing 10% lipoprotein-deficient serum to the cells. The plates were incubated at 37.degree. C. for 4 h, and the cells were washed quickly with Tris-buffered saline before imaging. To label cellular nuclei, Hoechst 33342 at a final concentration of 0.1 .mu.g/ml was added to each well. The plates were run on an Opera imager (Evotec Technologies GmbH, Hamburg, Germany) with a .times.40 water immersion objective. Images were captured using excitation wavelengths of 405 nm for fluorescent nuclei and 635 nm for Alexa Fluor 647-labeled PCSK9. For each well, 11 individual fields containing >500 cells were captured for two emission wavelengths. The data were analyzed using a customized algorithm written using the Acapella language (Evotec Technologies GmbH). The algorithm identified and marked the nuclear and cytoplasmic areas of individual cells, followed by measurement of the total cytoplasmic intensity of the cell. The intensity was expressed in arbitrary fluorescent units.                For testing the 1D05 Ab, the identical procedure was used, but with either HEK293 or HepG2 cells. For HepG2 cells, the plates would not have been poly-D-lysine coated. 5 .mu.g/ml of AF647-labeled WT PCSK9 was added along with a titration of Fab ranging from 50 .mu.g/ml down. Using this procedure, we obtained IC.sub.50 values of roughly 80 nM for the Fab in both cell types.                Results: FIGS. 4A and 4B illustrate inhibition of PCSK9 internalization by the Fab 1D05 and IgG 1D05 and restoration of LDL uptake.                EXAMPLE 11                In Vivo Assay                Both Fab fragments and whole IgG of human 1D05 were tested in vivo in mice and changes in the level of LDL cholesterol were monitored. The mice used in these studies were (B6.times.B6-Tg(CETP) Ldlr.sup.tm1)F1 mice which are hemizygous for the transgenic (Tg) expression of human CETP (which mice lack) as well as the disruption of the LDL receptor (.sup.tm1). These mice are particularly useful because of their human-like lipid profiles and LDL-rich nature.                Each mouse was bled twice, once at the beginning of the study to establish individual baseline levels of LDL cholesterol (\"pre\") and a second time 3 hours later (\"post\") to assess what changes took place in LDL levels after treatment. Each mouse received two IV doses of Dulbecco's PBS as a vehicle control, 1D05 IgG (0.5 mg), or 1D05 Fab fragments (0.5 mg) over the course of 3 hours. The 1D05 whole IgG was centrifuged at 230,000.times.g to remove aggregates immediately prior to injection.                In FIG. 5, the LDL levels for each mouse are represented by a set of connected symbols and the change in LDL (postbleed-prebleed) is shown as an average for each treatment group (.DELTA. mg/dL). Treatment with PBS had no effect on LDL measurements (-4 mg/dL, 5% reduction). In contrast, serum LDL was reduced 20% with 1D05 whole IgG (-19 mg/dL) and 34% with Fab fragments of 1D05 (-24 mg/dL).                EXAMPLE 12                Limited Proteolysis                The limited proteolysis mass spectrometry strategy consists in the incubation of wt-hPCSK9 and 1D05/wt-hPCSK9 complex (substrates) with endoproteinase enzymes of different specificity in carefully controlled conditions (i.e., low enzymes concentration and short digestion time). Under these conditions, the endoproteases will cleave only the primary cleavage sites of the protein substrate (i.e., sites that are on the surface of the protein substrate and exposed to the solvent). The binding of 1D05 Fab to wt-hPCSK9 will mask some surface residues normally exposed to the solvent in both proteins. Therefore the primary sites cleaved in wt-hPCSK9 and not in the 1D05/wt-hPCSK9 complex correspond to residues of PCSK9 protected by 1D05 in the complex. Some of these residues are likely to be directly involved in 1D05 binding. The proteolytic peptides generated by wt-hPCSK9 and 1D05/wt-hPCSK9 limited proteolysis are identified and characterized by analysis of the digest by Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-MS). Finally, the use of endoproteases with different specificity helps to more accurately define the residues involved in binding.                The amount of proteolytic enzyme normally used in limited proteolysis experiments had to be considerably reduced to avoid excess hydrolysis of wt-hPCSK9 and loss of the primary binding sites (exposed residues). Incubation of wt-hPCSK9, 1D05 and 1D05/wt-hPCSK9 with endoproteases was done in 25 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl at room temperature. The endoproteases used were AspN added at a 2500/1 (w/w) excess of protein compared to proteolytic enzyme, and Trypsin and GluC added at a 1000/1 (w/w) protein to endoprotease ratio. At periods of time 5, 15 and 30 minutes after endoprotease addition, an aliquot of sample was deposited onto the MALDI target and subjected to direct MALDI-MS analysis in the presence of sinapinic acid (SA) as matrix. The fragment peptides originated from wt-PCSK9 after incubation with the proteolytic enzyme at various time were compared with those originated from wt-hPCSK9 in the 1D05/wt-hPCSK9 complex sample to identify the residues protected from proteolysis in the 1D05/wt-hPCSK9 interaction. The Figures and Tables provided herein report only the most relevant fragment peptides.                Limited proteolysis with endoprotease AspN: The wt-hPCSK9 protein, 1D05/wt-hPCSK9 complex and 1D05 Fab were incubated for 5, 15 and 30 minutes in the presence of AspN, which cleaves N-terminally to Asp residues, at a 2500/1 (w/w) ratio between the protein and the proteolytic enzyme. MALDI-MS analysis of the digests revealed the primary wt-hPCSK9 and 1D05/wt-hPCSK9 complex cleavage sites (see FIGS. 7A and 7B and Table 5 below). Table 5 illustrates the wt-hPCSK9 fragment peptides obtained after AspN incubation for 5 minutes with wt-PCSK9 and 1D05/wt-hPCSK9 complex. In italics are peptides formed only when wt-hPCSK9 hydrolyzes.

Several species were formed in both wt-hPCSK9 and 1D05/wt-hPCSK9 hydrolyses. In particular the ions at m/z 2222.0 and 4412.9 corresponding to peptides 31-49 of the prodomain and 698-737 of the catalytic domain of wt-hPCSK9 were originated from cleavage at Asp49 and Asp698.                At longer endoprotease AspN incubation time (i.e., 15, 30 minutes) the peptide profile shown in the MALDI-MS spectra did not change significantly compared to the one at 5 minutes shown in FIGS. 7A and 7B confirming that Asp169 is protected from hydrolysis in the 1D05/wt-PCSK9 interaction.                It is important to note that the observed degree of agreement between the expected and measured mass values is within the norm for this type of experiment, since mass calibration must be made with an external standard.                Limited proteolysis with endoprotease GluC: Endoprotease GluC cleaves C-terminally Glu residues. Incubation of GluC with wt-hPCSK9, 1D05/wt-hPCSK9 complex and 1D05 was conducted at a 1000/1 and 100/1 (w/w) ratio between protein and proteolytic enzyme. To detect the primary cleavage sites, the MALDI-MS analysis of the samples was conducted after 5, 15 and 30 minutes of incubation. The wt-hPCSK9 residues cleaved in the wt-hPCSK9 protein and protected in the 1D05/wt-hPCSK9 complex, and the corresponding peptides detected in the MS spectrum, are shown in FIGS. 8A-H and Table 6 below. Table 6 illustrates peptide fragments obtained upon GluC incubation for 15 minutes with wt-PCSK9 and 1D05/wt-PCSK9 complex. In italics are the peptides originating from wt-PCSK9 and not from the complex.

The specie at m/z 3357.4, corresponding to peptide 153-181, and obtained in the incubation with GluC of both wt-hPCSK9 and 1D05/wt-hPCSK9, indicates that Glu181 is not protected by the Fab 1D05 binding to wt-hPCSK9.                Limited proteolysis with Trypsin: Trypsin cleaves C-terminally Arg and Lys residues. The enzyme was added at 1000 (w/w) ratio to wt-PCSK9, 1D05/wt-PCSK9 complex and 1D05 for 5, 15 and 30 minutes. MALDI-MS analysis of the wt-PCSK9 and 1D05/wt-PCSK9 complex is shown in FIGS. 9A-D and the most relevant peptide fragments are reported in Table 7.

The species at m/z 2279.3, 3909.9 and 4474.6 corresponding to peptides 200-218, 166-199 and 161-199 are detected only in the wt-hPCSK9 hydrolysis and indicate that residue Arg 199 is protected by 1D05 binding. These peptide fragments together with the species at m/z 5410.5, 5729.7, 5850.8, 6170.2 correspond to peptides 168-215, 166-215, 168-218, 166-218, detected only in wt-PCSK9 thus indicating protection also on residues Arg165 and Arg167.                At 15 minutes of Trypsin incubation, protection on residue Arg199 is confirmed. In fact the species at m/z 2280.0, 3591.4, 3910.9 and 4475.6, all originated from cleavage at Arg199, are present only in the wt-PCSK9 hydrolysis and become more abundant. In addition, protection at Arg194 is detected (as shown by the presence of the specie at m/z 3325.7 in the wt-PCSK9 spectrum). The species originated from cleavage at Arg165 and Arg167 (m/z 5411.5, 5730.9, 5851.8 and 6171.6) are present in the wt-hPCSK9 hydrolysis and start to appear with much lower intensity also in the 1D05/wt-hPCSK9 complex proteolysis. This may indicate that the protection from proteolysis on such residues is due to steric hindrance of the Fab rather than to primary contacts between 1D05 and wt-PCSK9 residues.                Results: With LP-MS using three enzymes of different specificity, we identified the surface area of wt-hPCSK9 protected by the 1D05 Fab in the 1D05-wt-hPCSK9. Arg165, Arg167, Asp169, Glu170, Arg194, Glu197 and Arg199 are the residues of wt-hPCSK9 protected upon binding to the 1D05 Fab (see FIG. 10). These residues belong to the catalytic domain of wt-hPCSK9 and are exposed on the surface of the molecule (see FIG. 11). In addition, the limited proteolysis with trypsin shows the possibility that residues 194-199 are directly involved in 1D05 binding whereas protection from proteolysis on residues Arg165 and Arg167 may be due to steric hindrance of the Fab instead of direct contacts between 1D05 and wt-PCSK9 residues.                Residues in peptides R194-R199 are conserved in human and mouse PCSK9. 1D05 Fab recognizes human and mouse protein. As illustrated by the sequence alignment between human and mouse PCSK9 (see FIG. 12), the residues included in the peptide 194-199 of wt-PCSK9 and protected by 1D05 are conserved in both human and mouse PCSK9 while residues in peptide 165-169 (also protected by 1D05 binding) are not. This would support a hypothesis that only residues 194-199 are directly interacting with 1D05 while the others (165-169) are protected from proteolysis by steric hindrance.                EXAMPLE 13                PCSK9/1D05 TR-FRET Assay                Anti-V5 antibody (QED Biosciences) was labeled and purified as described previously (see Fisher et al., 2007 J. Biol. Chem. 282 (28): 20502-20512) using 4 equivalents of AlexaFluor 647 (Invitrogen). 1D05 IgG was labeled in a similar manner using 5 equivalents of Eu(W8044)-DTA (Perkin-Elmer). Materials were protected from light and stored at 4.degree. C. prior to use. V5/His-PCSK9 was generated as described previously (see Fisher et al., Id.).                TR-FRET assays were carried out in black Microfluor 2 96 well plates (Dynex Technologies) in 10 mM Hepes pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 100 uM CaCl.sub.2 and 0.05% BSA. To 25 .mu.L of 20 nM each AF647 labeled anti-V5 antibody and V5/His-PCSK9 was added a serial dilution of the unlabeled candidate antibody (i.e., 1D05 and 1B20), either Fab or IgG. Reagents were equilibrated for .about.15 minutes at room temperature and then Eu(W8044)-1D05 IgG was added to give a final concentration of 1.5 nM Eu labeled antibody (.about.18000 counts at Fl.sub.620 nm; S/B=12) and a total volume of 50 uL. After, equilibration assays were read in a BMG LabTech Rubystar Reader as described previously (Fisher et al., Id.). Data are reported as Fl.sub.665/Fl.sub.620.times.10000. IC.sub.50s were determined using data fitted to a sigmoidal dose response curve using non-linear regression analysis (Kaleidagraph 4.03, Synergy Software).                FIG. 13 illustrates an analysis of 1D05 and a distinct antibody 1B20 in a PCSK9-1D05 interaction TR-FRET assay. Both Fabs are potent and inhibit the interaction fully. FIGS. 14A-D illustrates 1B20's inhibition of PCSK9 in the Exopolar assay described, e.g., in Example 9. 1B20 Fab inhibited murine PCSK9 at an IC.sub.50 of 152 nM (n=5); and human PCSK9 at an IC.sub.50 of 145 nM (n=5). IB20 IgG inhibited murine PCSK9 at an IC.sub.50 of 13 nM; and human PCSK9 at an IC.sub.50 of 22 nM. The binding particulars of 1B20 Fab are illustrated in the following Table.

All Rhesus monkeys used in the study were naive to biologics.                Monkeys were given an IV bolus dose of 1D05 via the cephalic vein. Blood samples were collected from the saphenous/femoral vessel at designated time points post dosing and the resulting plasma/serum was stored at -70.degree. C. until analysis.                The dosing solutions of 1D05 were prepared at 47.2 mg/mL in 100 mM Histidine, 100 mM Arginine, 6% sucrose, pH 6.0. The dosing solutions were stored at 4.degree. C. and kept on wet ice during dosing.                The lipoprotein analysis of the serum samples were carried out as described below. An anti-human IgG ELISA using commercially available reagents was used to quantify 1D05 levels.                As shown in FIG. 15, 1D05 lowered LDL-C by .about.50% at 3 mpk and .gtoreq.25% LDL-C lowering was observed for .about.16 days. The t.sub.1/2 of 1D05 (FIG. 16) was 77 hr.                EXAMPLE 15                Lipoprotein Analysis of Plasma/Serum Samples from 1D05 Rhesus PK/PD Study                To generate lipoprotein profiles, plasma or serum was fractionated by chromatography over Superose-6 size exclusion column (GE LifeSciences, Inc.). Total cholesterol levels in the column effluent were continuously measured via in-line mixture with a commercially available enzymatic colorimetric cholesterol detection reagent (Total Cholesterol E, Wako USA) followed by downstream spectrophotometric detection of the reaction products at 600 nm absorbance. The first peak of cholesterol eluted from the column was attributed to VLDL, the second peak to LDL and the third to HDL; the area under each peak was calculated using software provided with the HPLC. To calculate the cholesterol concentration for each lipoprotein fraction, the ratio of the corresponding peak area to total peak area was multiplied by the total cholesterol concentration measured in the sample.                EXAMPLE 16                Formulation                Monoclonal antibodies comprising a light chain comprising SEQ ID NO: 26 and a heavy chain comprising SEQ ID NO: 25) were dialyzed into the appropriate formulations and concentrated. Solutions were then dispensed into 3 mL glass vials for stability studies. Studies carried out in liquid form were immediately placed on stability at 2-8.degree. C. or 25.degree. C.                Analytical methods included Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC-HPLC) to measure aggregation and fragmentation. Below is a table of Time 0 and 6M SEC data. The formulations containing Mar. 50, 1950 or 6/100/100 (sucrose/His/Arg) form fewer aggregates and fragments after storage for 6 months at 2-8.degree. C. or 25.degree. C.

The sequence listing contained in this .txt file is part of the specification and is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.                FIELD OF THE INVENTION                The present invention relates to antibodies, e.g., full length antibodies or antigen-binding portions thereof, peptides, and aptamers that antagonize the activity of extracellular proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9), including its interaction with the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (LDLR). More specifically, the invention relates to compositions comprising antagonist PCSK9 antibodies, peptides, and/or aptamers and methods of using these antibodies and/or peptides and/or aptamers as a medicament. The antagonist PCSK9 antibodies, peptides, and aptamers can be used therapeutically to lower LDL-cholesterol levels in blood, and can be used in the prevention and/or treatment of cholesterol and lipoprotein metabolism disorders, including familial hypercholesterolemia, atherogenic dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, and, more generally, cardiovascular disease (CVD).                BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION                Millions of people in the U.S. are at risk for heart disease and resulting cardiac events. CVD and underlying atherosclerosis is the leading cause of death among all demographic groups, despite the availability of therapies directed at its multiple risk factors. Atherosclerosis is a disease of the arteries and is responsible for coronary heart disease associated with many deaths in industrialized countries. Several risk factors for coronary heart disease have now been identified: dyslipidemias, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, poor diet, inactivity and stress. The most clinically relevant and common dyslipidemias are characterized by an increase in beta-lipoproteins (very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and LDL) with hypercholesterolemia in the absence or presence of hypertriglyceridemia (Fredrickson et al., 1967, N Engl J Med. 276:34-42, 94-103, 148-156, 215-225, and 273-281). There is a long-felt significant unmet need with respect to CVD with 60-70% of cardiovascular events, heart attacks and strokes occurring despite the treatment with statins (the current standard of care in atherosclerosis). Moreover, new guidelines suggest that even lower LDL levels should be achieved in order to protect high risk patients from premature CVD [National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP), 2004].                PCSK9, also known as NARC-1, was identified as a protein with a genetic mutation in some forms of familial hypercholesterolemia. PCSK9 is synthesized as a zymogen that undergoes autocatalytic processing at the motif LVFAQ in the endoplasmic reticulum. Population studies have shown that some PCSK9 mutations are \"gain-of-function\" and are found in individuals with autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia, while other \"loss-of-function\" (LOF) mutations are linked with reduced plasma cholesterol. Morbidity and mortality studies in this group clearly demonstrated that reducing PCSK9 function significantly diminished the risk of cardiovascular disease.                Of significant importance to the treatment of CVD, a LOF mutation may sensitize humans to statins, allowing for efficacy at a lower dose (hence, improving risks associated with safety and tolerance) and potentially achieving lower plasma cholesterol levels than with current therapies.                PCSK9 is secreted into the plasma predominantly by hepatocytes. Genetic modulation of PCSK9 in mice confirmed the ability of PCSK9 to regulate blood lipids, and suggested that it acts to down-regulate hepatic LDLR protein levels.                The mechanism by which, and the site at which, PCSK9 down-regulates LDLR protein has not been clearly established. When over-expressed, PCSK9 may act both within the hepatocyte and as a secreted ligand for LDLR. There is strong evidence that extracellular PCSK9 binds to cell surface LDLR and promotes LDLR degradation at an intracellular site. However, it is also possible that PCSK9 could interact with the LDLR when the two proteins are translated within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and traffic through endosomal compartments towards the cell membrane. Maxwell et al., 2005, Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 16:167-172, showed that PCSK9-mediated LDLR endocytosis and degradation was not altered by proteosome inhibitors nor was it modulated by different classes of lysosomal and nonlysosomal proteases. Two naturally occurring familial hypercholesterolemia mutations, S127R and D129G, have been reported to be defective in autoprocessing and secretion as levels of these mutant proteins were greatly reduced or undetectable in the media of transfected cells. Yet these mutants demonstrated an enhanced ability to down-regulate LDLR, consistent with their identification in individuals with high plasma LDL (Homer et al., 2008, Atherosclerosis 196:659-666; Cameron et al., 2006 Human Molecular Genetics 15:1551-1558; Lambert et al., 2006, TRENDS in Endocrinology and Metabolism 17:79-81. Since these mutants apparently do not get secreted extracellularly, and yet do downregulate LDLR, this strongly suggests that an intracellular site of action is physiologically important.                From the information available in the art, and prior to the present invention, it remained unclear whether the introduction of an antibody-, peptide-, or aptamer-based PCSK9 antagonist into the blood circulation to selectively antagonize extracellular PCSK9 would be effective to reduce hypercholesterolemia and the associated incidence of CVD and, if so, what properties of a PCSK9 antagonist are needed for such in vivo effectiveness.                SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION                This invention relates to antagonist antibodies, peptides, and aptamers that selectively interact with and inhibit PCSK9 function. It is demonstrated for the first time that certain PCSK9 antagonists are effective in vivo to lower blood cholesterol.                In one embodiment, the invention provides an isolated antagonist of PCSK9 which comprises an antibody, a peptide, or an aptamer, which interacts with PCSK9 and when administered to a subject lowers the LDL-cholesterol level in blood of said subject. The antagonist can be an antibody, for example, a monoclonal antibody or human, humanized, or chimeric antibody.                In another embodiment, the invention provides an isolated anti-PCSK9 antibody which specifically binds to PCSK9 and which is a full antagonist of the PCSK9-mediated effect on LDLR levels when measured in vitro using the LDLR down regulation assay in Huh7 cells disclosed herein.                In yet another embodiment, the invention provides an isolated antibody which antagonizes the extracellular interaction of PCSK9 with the LDLR, as measured by PCSK9 binding to the LDLR in vitro, and, when administered to a subject, lowers the LDL-cholesterol level in blood of said subject. Preferably, the antibody recognizes an epitope on human PCSK9 that overlaps with more than about 75% of the surface on PCSK9 that interacts with the EGF-like domain of the LDLR as described in Kwon et al., 2008, PNAS, 105:1820-1825.                In yet another embodiment, the invention provides an antibody that recognizes a first epitope of PCSK9 that overlaps with a second epitope that is recognized by a monoclonal antibody selected from the group consisting of 5A10, which is produced by a hybridoma cell line deposited with the American Type Culture Collection and assigned accession number PTA-8986; 4A5, which is produced by a hybridoma cell line deposited with the American Type Culture Collection and assigned accession number PTA-8985; 6F6, which is produced by a hybridoma cell line deposited with the American Type Culture Collection and assigned accession number PTA-8984, and 7D4, which is produced by a hybridoma cell line deposited with the American Type Culture Collection and assigned accession number PTA-8983.                In another embodiment, the invention provides an antibody to human PCSK9, wherein the antibody recognizes an epitope on human PCSK9 comprising amino acid residues 153-155, 194, 195, 197, 237-239, 367, 369, 374-379 and 381 of the PCSK9 amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 53.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION                The present invention relates to antibodies, peptides, and aptamers that antagonize the function of extracellular PCSK9 including its interaction with the LDLR. More specifically, the invention relates to methods of making antagonist PCSK9 antibodies, peptides, and aptamers, compositions comprising these antibodies, peptides, and/or aptamers, and methods of using these antibodies, peptides, and/or aptamers as a medicament. The antagonist PCSK9 antibodies and peptides can be used to lower blood LDL-cholesterol levels, and can be used in the prevention and/or treatment of cholesterol and lipoprotein metabolism disorders, including familial hypercholesterolemia, atherogenic dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, and, more generally, CVD.                General Techniques                The practice of the present invention will employ, unless otherwise indicated, conventional techniques of molecular biology (including recombinant techniques), microbiology, cell biology, biochemistry and immunology, which are within the skill of the art.

Capra, eds., Harwood Academic Publishers, 1995).                DEFINITIONS                An \"antibody\" is an immunoglobulin molecule capable of specific binding to a target, such as a carbohydrate, polynucleotide, lipid, polypeptide, etc., through at least one antigen recognition site, located in the variable region of the immunoglobulin molecule. As used herein, the term encompasses not only intact polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies, but also fragments thereof (such as Fab, Fab', F(ab').sub.2, Fv), single chain (ScFv) and domain antibodies), and fusion proteins comprising an antibody portion, and any other modified configuration of the immunoglobulin molecule that comprises an antigen recognition site. An antibody includes an antibody of any class, such as IgG, IgA, or IgM (or sub-class thereof), and the antibody need not be of any particular class. Depending on the antibody amino acid sequence of the constant domain of its heavy chains, immunoglobulins can be assigned to different classes. There are five major classes of immunoglobulins: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, and several of these may be further divided into subclasses (isotypes), e.g., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA1 and IgA2. The heavy-chain constant domains that correspond to the different classes of immunoglobulins are called alpha, delta, epsilon, gamma, and mu, respectively. The subunit structures and three-dimensional configurations of different classes of immunoglobulins are well known.                As used herein, \"monoclonal antibody\" refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally-occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed against a single antigenic site. Furthermore, in contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations, which typically include different antibodies directed against different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single determinant on the antigen. The modifier \"monoclonal\" indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example, the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by the hybridoma method first described by Kohler and Milstein, 1975, Nature 256:495, or may be made by recombinant DNA methods such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567. The monoclonal antibodies may also be isolated from phage libraries generated using the techniques described in McCafferty et al., 1990, Nature 348:552-554, for example.                As used herein, \"humanized\" antibody refers to forms of non-human (e.g., murine) antibodies that are chimeric immunoglobulins, immunoglobulin chains, or fragments thereof (such as Fv, Fab, Fab', F(ab').sub.2 or other antigen-binding subsequences of antibodies) that contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. Preferably, humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in which residues from a complementary determining region (CDR) of the recipient are replaced by residues from a CDR of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat, or rabbit having the desired specificity, affinity, and capacity. In some instances, Fv framework region (FR) residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Furthermore, the humanized antibody may comprise residues that are found neither in the recipient antibody nor in the imported CDR or framework sequences, but are included to further refine and optimize antibody performance. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the CDR regions correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin consensus sequence. The humanized antibody optimally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region or domain (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin. Preferred are antibodies having Fc regions modified as described in WO 99/58572. Other forms of humanized antibodies have one or more CDRs (CDR L1, CDR L2, CDR L3, CDR H1, CDR H2, and/or CDR H3) which are altered with respect to the original antibody, which are also termed one or more CDRs \"derived from\" one or more CDRs from the original antibody.                As used herein, \"human antibody\" means an antibody having an amino acid sequence corresponding to that of an antibody that can be produced by a human and/or which has been made using any of the techniques for making human antibodies known to those skilled in the art or disclosed herein. This definition of a human antibody includes antibodies comprising at least one human heavy chain polypeptide or at least one human light chain polypeptide. One such example is an antibody comprising murine light chain and human heavy chain polypeptides. Human antibodies can be produced using various techniques known in the art. In one embodiment, the human antibody is selected from a phage library, where that phage library expresses human antibodies (Vaughan et al., 1996, Nature Biotechnology, 14:309-314; Sheets et al., 1998, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA) 95:6157-6162; Hoogenboom and Winter, 1991, J. Mol. Biol., 227:381; Marks et al., 1991, J. Mol. Biol., 222:581). Human antibodies can also be made by immunization of animals into which human immunoglobulin loci have been transgenically introduced in place of the endogenous loci, e.g., mice in which the endogenous immunoglobulin genes have been partially or completely inactivated. This approach is described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,545,807; 5,545,806; 5,569,825; 5,625,126; 5,633,425; and 5,661,016. Alternatively, the human antibody may be prepared by immortalizing human B lymphocytes that produce an antibody directed against a target antigen (such B lymphocytes may be recovered from an individual or may have been immunized in vitro). See, e.g., Cole et al. Monoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy, Alan R. Liss, p. 77, 1985; Boerner et al., 1991, J. Immunol., 147 (1):86-95; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,750,373.                A \"variable region\" of an antibody refers to the variable region of the antibody light chain or the variable region of the antibody heavy chain, either alone or in combination. As known in the art, the variable regions of the heavy and light chain each consist of four framework regions (FR) connected by three complementarity determining regions (CDRs) that contain hypervariable regions. The CDRs in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FRs and, with the CDRs from the other chain, contribute to the formation of the antigen-binding site of antibodies. There are at least two techniques for determining CDRs: (1) an approach based on cross-species sequence variability (i.e., Kabat et al. Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, (5th ed., 1991, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda Md.)); and (2) an approach based on crystallographic studies of antigen-antibody complexes (Al-lazikani et al, 1997, J. Molec. Biol. 273:927-948). As used herein, a CDR may refer to CDRs defined by either approach or by a combination of both approaches.                As known in the art a \"constant region\" of an antibody refers to the constant region of the antibody light chain or the constant region of the antibody heavy chain, either alone or in combination.                As used herein, the term \"PCSK9\" refers to any form of PCSK9 and variants thereof that retain at least part of the activity of PCSK9. Unless indicated differently, such as by specific reference to human PCSK9, PCSK9 includes all mammalian species of native sequence PCSK9, e.g., human, canine, feline, equine, and bovine. One exemplary human PCSK9 is found as Uniprot Accession Number Q8NBP7 (SEQ ID NO:16).                As used herein, a \"PCSK9 antagonist\" refers to an antibody, peptide, or aptamer that is able to inhibit PCSK9 biological activity and/or downstream pathway(s) mediated by PCSK9 signaling, including PCSK9-mediated down-regulation of the LDLR, and PCSK9-mediated decrease in LDL blood clearance. A PCSK9 antagonist antibody encompasses antibodies that block, antagonize, suppress or reduce (to any degree including significantly) PCSK9 biological activity, including downstream pathways mediated by PCSK9 signaling, such as LDLR interaction and/or elicitation of a cellular response to PCSK9. For purpose of the present invention, it will be explicitly understood that the term \"PCSK9 antagonist antibody\" encompasses all the previously identified terms, titles, and functional states and characteristics whereby the PCSK9 itself, a PCSK9 biological activity (including but not limited to its ability to mediate any aspect of interaction with the LDLR, down regulation of LDLR, and decreased blood LDL clearance), or the consequences of the biological activity, are substantially nullified, decreased, or neutralized in any meaningful degree. In some embodiments, a PCSK9 antagonist antibody binds PCSK9 and prevents interaction with the LDLR. Examples of PCSK9 antagonist antibodies are provided herein.                As used herein a \"full antagonist\" is an antagonist which, at an effective concentration, essentially completely blocks a measurable effect of PCSK9. By a partial antagonist is meant an antagonist that is capable of partially blocking a measurable effect, but that, even at a highest concentration is not a full antagonist. By essentially completely is meant at least about 80%, preferably, at least about 90%, more preferably, at least about 95%, and most preferably, at least about 98% or 99% of the measurable effect is blocked. The relevant \"measurable effects\" are described herein and include down regulation of LDLR by a PCSK9 antagonist as assayed in Huh7 cells in vitro, in vivo decrease in blood (or plasma) levels of total cholesterol, and in vivo decrease in LDL levels in blood (or plasma).                As used herein, the term \"clinically meaningful\" means at least a 15% reduction in blood LDL-cholesterol levels in humans or at least a 15% reduction in total blood cholesterol in mice. It is clear that measurements in plasma or serum can serve as surrogates for measurement of levels in blood.                As used herein, the term \"PCSK9 antagonist peptide\" or \"PCSK9 antagonist aptamer\" includes any conventional peptide or polypeptide or aptamer that blocks, antagonizes, suppresses or reduces (to any degree including significantly) PCSK9 biological activity, including downstream pathways mediated by PCSK9 signaling, such as LDLR interaction and/or elicitation of a cellular response to PCSK9. PCSK9 antagonist peptides or polypeptides include Fc fusions comprising the LDLR and soluble portions of the LDLR, or mutants thereof with higher affinity to PCSK9.                The terms \"polypeptide\", \"oligopeptide\", \"peptide\" and \"protein\" are used interchangeably herein to refer to chains of amino acids of any length, preferably, relatively short (e.g., 10-100 amino acids). The chain may be linear or branched, it may comprise modified amino acids, and/or may be interrupted by non-amino acids. The terms also encompass an amino acid chain that has been modified naturally or by intervention; for example, disulfide bond formation, glycosylation, lipidation, acetylation, phosphorylation, or any other manipulation or modification, such as conjugation with a labeling component. Also included within the definition are, for example, polypeptides containing one or more analogs of an amino acid (including, for example, unnatural amino acids, etc.), as well as other modifications known in the art. It is understood that the polypeptides can occur as single chains or associated chains.                As known in the art, \"polynucleotide,\" or \"nucleic acid,\" as used interchangeably herein, refer to chains of nucleotides of any length, and include DNA and RNA. The nucleotides can be deoxyribonucleotides, ribonucleotides, modified nucleotides or bases, and/or their analogs, or any substrate that can be incorporated into a chain by DNA or RNA polymerase. A polynucleotide may comprise modified nucleotides, such as methylated nucleotides and their analogs. If present, modification to the nucleotide structure may be imparted before or after assembly of the chain. The sequence of nucleotides may be interrupted by non-nucleotide components. A polynucleotide may be further modified after polymerization, such as by conjugation with a labeling component. Other types of modifications include, for example, \"caps\", substitution of one or more of the naturally occurring nucleotides with an analog, internucleotide modifications such as, for example, those with uncharged linkages (e.g., methyl phosphonates, phosphotriesters, phosphoamidates, carbamates, etc.) and with charged linkages (e.g., phosphorothioates, phosphorodithioates, etc.), those containing pendant moieties, such as, for example, proteins (e.g., nucleases, toxins, antibodies, signal peptides, poly-L-lysine, etc.), those with intercalators (e.g., acridine, psoralen, etc.), those containing chelators (e.g., metals, radioactive metals, boron, oxidative metals, etc.), those containing alkylators, those with modified linkages (e.g., alpha anomeric nucleic acids, etc.), as well as unmodified forms of the polynucleotide(s). Further, any of the hydroxyl groups ordinarily present in the sugars may be replaced, for example, by phosphonate groups, phosphate groups, protected by standard protecting groups, or activated to prepare additional linkages to additional nucleotides, or may be conjugated to solid supports. The 5' and 3' terminal OH can be phosphorylated or substituted with amines or organic capping group moieties of from 1 to 20 carbon atoms. Other hydroxyls may also be derivatized to standard protecting groups. Polynucleotides can also contain analogous forms of ribose or deoxyribose sugars that are generally known in the art, including, for example, 2'-O-methyl-, 2'-O-allyl, 2'-fluoro- or 2'-azido-ribose, carbocyclic sugar analogs, alpha- or beta-anomeric sugars, epimeric sugars such as arabinose, xyloses or lyxoses, pyranose sugars, furanose sugars, sedoheptuloses, acyclic analogs and abasic nucleoside analogs such as methyl riboside. One or more phosphodiester linkages may be replaced by alternative linking groups. These alternative linking groups include, but are not limited to, embodiments wherein phosphate is replaced by P(O)S(\"thioate\"), P(S)S (\"dithioate\"), (O)NR.sub.2 (\"amidate\"), P(O)R, P(O)OR', CO or CH.sub.2 (\"formacetal\"), in which each R or R' is independently H or substituted or unsubstituted alkyl (1-20 C) optionally containing an ether (--O--) linkage, aryl, alkenyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl or araldyl. Not all linkages in a polynucleotide need be identical. The preceding description applies to all polynucleotides referred to herein, including RNA and DNA.                A \"PCSK9 antagonist aptamer,\" which comprises a nucleic acid or protein sequence, is, for example, selected from a large pool of random sequences and specifically binds PCSK9. The nucleic acid of the aptamer is double-stranded DNA or single-strand RNA. Nucleic acid aptamers can include modified bases or functional groups, including but not limited to 2'-fluorine nucleotides and 2'-O-methyl nucleotides. Aptamers can include hydrophilic polymers, for example, polyethylene glycol. Aptamers may be made by methods known in the art and selected for PCSK9 antagonist activity by routine modification of the methods disclosed in the Examples.                As used herein, an antibody, peptide, or aptamer \"interacts with\" PCSK9 when the equilibrium dissociation constant is equal to or less than 20 nM, preferably less than about 6 nM, more preferably less than about 1 nM, most preferably less than about 0.2 nM, as measured by the methods disclosed herein in Example 2.                An epitope that \"preferentially binds\" or \"specifically binds\" (used interchangeably herein) to an antibody or a polypeptide is a term well understood in the art, and methods to determine such specific or preferential binding are also well known in the art. A molecule is said to exhibit \"specific binding\" or \"preferential binding\" if it reacts or associates more frequently, more rapidly, with greater duration and/or with greater affinity with a particular cell or substance than it does with alternative cells or substances. An antibody \"specifically binds\" or \"preferentially binds\" to a target if it binds with greater affinity, avidity, more readily, and/or with greater duration than it binds to other substances. For example, an antibody that specifically or preferentially binds to a PCSK9 epitope is an antibody that binds this epitope with greater affinity, avidity, more readily, and/or with greater duration than it binds to other PCSK9 epitopes or non-PCSK9 epitopes. It is also understood by reading this definition that, for example, an antibody (or moiety or epitope) that specifically or preferentially binds to a first target may or may not specifically or preferentially bind to a second target. As such, \"specific binding\" or \"preferential binding\" does not necessarily require (although it can include) exclusive binding. Generally, but not necessarily, reference to binding means preferential binding.                As used herein, \"substantially pure\" refers to material which is at least 50% pure (i.e., free from contaminants), more preferably, at least 90% pure, more preferably, at least 95% pure, yet more preferably, at least 98% pure, and most preferably, at least 99% pure.                A \"host cell\" includes an individual cell or cell culture that can be or has been a recipient for vector(s) for incorporation of polynucleotide inserts. Host cells include progeny of a single host cell, and the progeny may not necessarily be completely identical (in morphology or in genomic DNA complement) to the original parent cell due to natural, accidental, or deliberate mutation. A host cell includes cells transfected in vivo with a polynucleotide(s) of this invention.                As known in the art, the term \"Fc region\" is used to define a C-terminal region of an immunoglobulin heavy chain. The \"Fc region\" may be a native sequence Fc region or a variant Fc region. Although the boundaries of the Fc region of an immunoglobulin heavy chain might vary, the human IgG heavy chain Fc region is usually defined to stretch from an amino acid residue at position Cys226, or from Pro230, to the carboxyl-terminus thereof. The numbering of the residues in the Fc region is that of the EU index as in Kabat. Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md., 1991. The Fc region of an immunoglobulin generally comprises two constant domains, CH2 and CH3.                As used in the art, \"Fc receptor\" and \"FcR\" describe a receptor that binds to the Fc region of an antibody. The preferred FcR is a native sequence human FcR. Moreover, a preferred FcR is one which binds an IgG antibody (a gamma receptor) and includes receptors of the Fc.gamma.RI, Fc.gamma.RII, and Fc.gamma.RIII subclasses, including allelic variants and alternatively spliced forms of these receptors. Fc.gamma.RII receptors include Fc.gamma.RIIA (an \"activating receptor\") and Fc.gamma.RIIB (an \"inhibiting receptor\"), which have similar amino acid sequences that differ primarily in the cytoplasmic domains thereof. FcRs are reviewed in Ravetch and Kinet, 1991, Ann. Rev. Immunol., 9:457-92; Capel et al., 1994, Immunomethods, 4:25-34; and de Haas et al., 1995, J. Lab. Clin. Med., 126:330-41. \"FcR\" also includes the neonatal receptor, FcRn, which is responsible for the transfer of maternal IgGs to the fetus (Guyer et al., 1976 J. Immunol., 117:587; and Kim et al., 1994, J. Immunol., 24:249).                The term \"compete\", as used herein with regard to an antibody, means that a first antibody, or an antigen-binding portion thereof, binds to an epitope in a manner sufficiently similar to the binding of a second antibody, or an antigen-binding portion thereof, such that the result of binding of the first antibody with its cognate epitope is detectably decreased in the presence of the second antibody compared to the binding of the first antibody in the absence of the second antibody. The alternative, where the binding of the second antibody to its epitope is also detectably decreased in the presence of the first antibody, can, but need not be the case. That is, a first antibody can inhibit the binding of a second antibody to its epitope without that second antibody inhibiting the binding of the first antibody to its respective epitope. However, where each antibody detectably inhibits the binding of the other antibody with its cognate epitope or ligand, whether to the same, greater, or lesser extent, the antibodies are said to \"cross-compete\" with each other for binding of their respective epitope(s). Both competing and cross-competing antibodies are encompassed by the present invention. Regardless of the mechanism by which such competition or cross-competition occurs (e.g., steric hindrance, conformational change, or binding to a common epitope, or portion thereof), the skilled artisan would appreciate, based upon the teachings provided herein, that such competing and/or cross-competing antibodies are encompassed and can be useful for the methods disclosed herein.                By an antibody with an epitope that \"overlaps\" with another (second) epitope or with a surface on PCSK9 that interacts with the EGF-like domain of the LDLR is meant the sharing of space in terms of the PCSK9 residues that are interacted with. To calculate the percent of overlap, for example, the percent overlap of the claimed antibody's PCSK9 epitope with the surface of PCSK9 which interacts with the EGF-like domain of the LDLR, the surface area of PCSK9 buried when in complex with the LDLR is calculated on a per-residue basis. The buried area is also calculated for these residues in the PCSK9:antibody complex. To prevent more than 100% possible overlap, surface area for residues that have higher buried surface area in the PCSK9:antibody complex than in LDLR:PCSK9 complex is set to values from the LDLR:PCSK9 complex (100%). Percent surface overlap is calculated by summing over all of the LDLR:PCSK9 interacting residues and is weighted by the interaction area.                A \"functional Fc region\" possesses at least one effector function of a native sequence Fc region. Exemplary \"effector functions\" include Clq binding; complement dependent cytotoxicity; Fc receptor binding; antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity; phagocytosis; down-regulation of cell surface receptors (e.g., B cell receptor), etc. Such effector functions generally require the Fc region to be combined with a binding domain (e.g., an antibody variable domain) and can be assessed using various assays known in the art for evaluating such antibody effector functions.                A \"native sequence Fc region\" comprises an amino acid sequence identical to the amino acid sequence of an Fc region found in nature. A \"variant Fc region\" comprises an amino acid sequence which differs from that of a native sequence Fc region by virtue of at least one amino acid modification, yet retains at least one effector function of the native sequence Fc region. Preferably, the variant Fc region has at least one amino acid substitution compared to a native sequence Fc region or to the Fc region of a parent polypeptide, e.g., from about one to about ten amino acid substitutions, and preferably, from about one to about five amino acid substitutions in a native sequence Fc region or in the Fc region of the parent polypeptide. The variant Fc region herein will preferably possess at least about 80% sequence identity with a native sequence Fc region and/or with an Fc region of a parent polypeptide, and most preferably, at least about 90% sequence identity therewith, more preferably, at least about 95%, at least about 96%, at least about 97%, at least about 98%, at least about 99% sequence identity therewith.                As used herein, \"treatment\" is an approach for obtaining beneficial or desired clinical results. For purposes of this invention, beneficial or desired clinical results include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following: enhancement of LDL clearance and reducing incidence or amelioration of aberrant cholesterol and/or lipoprotein levels resulting from metabolic and/or eating disorders, or including familial hypercholesterolemia, atherogenic dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, and, more generally, cardiovascular disease (CVD).                \"Reducing incidence\" means any of reducing severity (which can include reducing need for and/or amount of (e.g., exposure to) other drugs and/or therapies generally used for this condition. As is understood by those skilled in the art, individuals may vary in terms of their response to treatment, and, as such, for example, a \"method of reducing incidence\" reflects administering the PCSK9 antagonist antibody, peptide, or aptamer based on a reasonable expectation that such administration may likely cause such a reduction in incidence in that particular individual.                \"Ameliorating\" means a lessening or improvement of one or more symptoms as compared to not administering a PCSK9 antagonist antibody, peptide, or aptamer. \"Ameliorating\" also includes shortening or reduction in duration of a symptom.                As used herein, an \"effective dosage\" or \"effective amount\" of drug, compound, or pharmaceutical composition is an amount sufficient to effect any one or more beneficial or desired results. For prophylactic use, beneficial or desired results include eliminating or reducing the risk, lessening the severity, or delaying the outset of the disease, including biochemical, histological and/or behavioral symptoms of the disease, its complications and intermediate pathological phenotypes presenting during development of the disease. For therapeutic use, beneficial or desired results include clinical results such as reducing hypercholesterolemia or one or more symptoms of dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, CVD, or coronary heart disease, decreasing the dose of other medications required to treat the disease, enhancing the effect of another medication, and/or delaying the progression of the disease of patients. An effective dosage can be administered in one or more administrations. For purposes of this invention, an effective dosage of drug, compound, or pharmaceutical composition is an amount sufficient to accomplish prophylactic or therapeutic treatment either directly or indirectly. As is understood in the clinical context, an effective dosage of a drug, compound, or pharmaceutical composition may or may not be achieved in conjunction with another drug, compound, or pharmaceutical composition. Thus, an \"effective dosage\" may be considered in the context of administering one or more therapeutic agents, and a single agent may be considered to be given in an effective amount if, in conjunction with one or more other agents, a desirable result may be or is achieved.                An \"individual\" or a \"subject\" is a mammal, more preferably, a human. Mammals also include, but are not limited to, farm animals, sport animals, pets, primates, horses, dogs, cats, mice and rats.                As used herein, \"vector\" means a construct, which is capable of delivering, and, preferably, expressing, one or more gene(s) or sequence(s) of interest in a host cell. Examples of vectors include, but are not limited to, viral vectors, naked DNA or RNA expression vectors, plasmid, cosmid or phage vectors, DNA or RNA expression vectors associated with cationic condensing agents, DNA or RNA expression vectors encapsulated in liposomes, and certain eukaryotic cells, such as producer cells.                As used herein, \"expression control sequence\" means a nucleic acid sequence that directs transcription of a nucleic acid. An expression control sequence can be a promoter, such as a constitutive or an inducible promoter, or an enhancer. The expression control sequence is operably linked to the nucleic acid sequence to be transcribed.                As used herein, \"pharmaceutically acceptable carrier\" or \"pharmaceutical acceptable excipient\" includes any material which, when combined with an active ingredient, allows the ingredient to retain biological activity and is non-reactive with the subject's immune system. Examples include, but are not limited to, any of the standard pharmaceutical carriers such as a phosphate buffered saline solution, water, emulsions such as oil/water emulsion, and various types of wetting agents. Preferred diluents for aerosol or parenteral administration are phosphate buffered saline (PBS) or normal (0.9%) saline. Compositions comprising such carriers are formulated by well known conventional methods (see, for example, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th edition, A. Gennaro, ed., Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., 1990; and Remington, The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 20th Ed., Mack Publishing, 2000).                The term \"K.sub.on\", as used herein, refers to the rate constant for association of an antibody to an antigen. Specifically, the rate constants (k.sub.on and k.sub.off) and equilibrium dissociation constants are measured using Fab antibody fragments (i.e., univalent) and PCSK9.                The term \"k.sub.off\", as used herein, refers to the rate constant for dissociation of an antibody from the antibody/antigen complex.                The term \"K.sub.D\", as used herein, refers to the equilibrium dissociation constant of an antibody-antigen interaction.                A. Methods for Preventing or Treating Disorders Associated with Hypercholesterolemia                In one aspect, the invention provides a method for treating or preventing hypercholesterolemia, and/or at least one symptom of dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, CVD or coronary heart disease, in an individual comprising administering to the individual an effective amount of a PCSK9 antagonist antibody or peptide or aptamer that antagonizes circulating PCSK9.                In a further aspect, the invention provides an effective amount of a PCSK9 antagonist antibody, peptide, or aptamer that antagonizes circulating PCSK9 for use in treating or preventing hypercholesterolemia, and/or at least one symptom of dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, CVD or coronary heart disease, in an individual. The invention further provides the use of an effective amount of a PCSK9 antagonist antibody, peptide, or aptamer that antagonizes extracellular or circulating PCSK9 in the manufacture of a medicament for treating or preventing hypercholesterolemia, and/or at least one symptom of dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, CVD or coronary heart disease, in an individual.                Advantageously, therapeutic administration of the antibody, peptide, or aptamer results in lower blood cholesterol and/or lower blood LDL. Preferably, blood cholesterol and/or blood LDL is at least about 10% or 15% lower than before administration. More preferably, blood cholesterol and/or blood LDL is at least about 20% lower than before administration of the antibody. Yet more preferably, blood cholesterol and/or blood LDL is at least 30% lower than before administration of the antibody. Advantageously, blood cholesterol and/or blood LDL is at least 40% lower than before administration of the antibody. More advantageously, blood cholesterol and/or blood LDL is at least 50% lower than before administration of the antibody. Very preferably, blood cholesterol and/or blood LDL is at least 60% lower than before administration of the antibody. Most preferably, blood cholesterol and/or blood LDL is at least 70% lower than before administration of the antibody.                With respect to all methods described herein, reference to PCSK9 antagonist antibodies, peptides, and aptamers also include compositions comprising one or more additional agents. These compositions may further comprise suitable excipients, such as pharmaceutically acceptable excipients including buffers, which are well known in the art. The present invention can be used alone or in combination with other conventional methods of treatment.                The PCSK9 antagonist antibody, peptide, or aptamer can be administered to an individual via any suitable route. It should be apparent to a person skilled in the art that the examples described herein are not intended to be limiting but to be illustrative of the techniques available. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the PCSK9 antagonist antibody, peptide, or aptamer is administered to an individual in accord with known methods, such as intravenous administration, e.g., as a bolus or by continuous infusion over a period of time, by intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intracerobrospinal, transdermal, subcutaneous, intra-articular, sublingually, intrasynovial, via insufflation, intrathecal, oral, inhalation or topical routes. Administration can be systemic, e.g., intravenous administration, or localized. Commercially available nebulizers for liquid formulations, including jet nebulizers and ultrasonic nebulizers are useful for administration. Liquid formulations can be directly nebulized and lyophilized powder can be nebulized after reconstitution. Alternatively, PCSK9 antagonist antibody, peptide, or aptamer can be aerosolized using a fluorocarbon formulation and a metered dose inhaler, or inhaled as a lyophilized and milled powder.                In one embodiment, a PCSK9 antagonist antibody, peptide, or aptamer is administered via site-specific or targeted local delivery techniques. Examples of site-specific or targeted local delivery techniques include various implantable depot sources of the PCSK9 antagonist antibody, peptide, or aptamer or local delivery catheters, such as infusion catheters, indwelling catheters, or needle catheters, synthetic grafts, adventitial wraps, shunts and stents or other implantable devices, site specific carriers, direct injection, or direct application. See, e.g., PCT Publ. No. WO 00/53211 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,981,568.                Various formulations of a PCSK9 antagonist antibody, peptide, or aptamer may be used for administration. In some embodiments, the PCSK9 antagonist antibody, peptide, or aptamer may be administered neat. In some embodiments, PCSK9 antagonist antibody, peptide, or aptamer and a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient may be in various formulations. Pharmaceutically acceptable excipients are known in the art, and are relatively inert substances that facilitate administration of a pharmacologically effective substance. For example, an excipient can give form or consistency, or act as a diluent. Suitable excipients include but are not limited to stabilizing agents, wetting and emulsifying agents, salts for varying osmolarity, encapsulating agents, buffers, and skin penetration enhancers. Excipients as well as formulations for parenteral and nonparenteral drug delivery are set forth in Remington, The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 20th Ed., Mack Publishing (2000).                These agents can be combined with pharmaceutically acceptable vehicles such as saline, Ringer's solution, dextrose solution, and the like. The particular dosage regimen, i.e., dose, timing and repetition, will depend on the particular individual and that individual's medical history.                PCSK9 antibodies can also be administered via inhalation, as described herein. Generally, for administration of PCSK9 antibodies, an initial candidate dosage can be about 2 mg/kg. For the purpose of the present invention, a typical daily dosage might range from about any of about 3 .mu.g/kg to 30 .mu.g/kg to 300 .mu.g/kg to 3 mg/kg, to 30 mg/kg, to 100 mg/kg or more, depending on the factors mentioned above. For example, dosage of about 1 mg/kg, about 2.5 mg/kg, about 5 mg/kg, about 10 mg/kg, and about 25 mg/kg may be used. For repeated administrations over several days or longer, depending on the condition, the treatment is sustained until a desired suppression of symptoms occurs or until sufficient therapeutic levels are achieved, for example, to reduce blood LDL levels. An exemplary dosing regimen comprises administering an initial dose of about 2 mg/kg, followed by a weekly maintenance dose of about 1 mg/kg of the PCSK9 antibody, or followed by a maintenance dose of about 1 mg/kg every other week. However, other dosage regimens may be useful, depending on the pattern of pharmacokinetic decay that the practitioner wishes to achieve. For example, in some embodiments, dosing from one to four times a week is contemplated. In other embodiments dosing once a month or once every other month or every three months is contemplated. The progress of this therapy is easily monitored by conventional techniques and assays. The dosing regimen (including the PCSK9 antagonist(s) used) can vary over time.                For the purpose of the present invention, the appropriate dosage of a PCSK9 antagonist antibody, peptide, or aptamer will depend on the PCSK9 antagonist antibody, peptide, or aptamer (or compositions thereof) employed, the type and severity of symptoms to be treated, whether the agent is administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes, previous therapy, the patient's clinical history and response to the agent, the patient's blood PCSK9 levels, the patient's synthesis and clearance rate for PCSK9, the patient's clearance rate for the administered agent, and the discretion of the attending physician. Typically the clinician will administer a PCSK9 antagonist antibody, peptide, or aptamer until a dosage is reached that achieves the desired result. Dose and/or frequency can vary over course of treatment. Empirical considerations, such as the half-life, generally will contribute to the determination of the dosage. For example, antibodies that are compatible with the human immune system, such as humanized antibodies or fully human antibodies, may be used to prolong half-life of the antibody and to prevent the antibody being attacked by the host's immune system. Frequency of administration may be determined and adjusted over the course of therapy, and is generally, but not necessarily, based on treatment and/or suppression and/or amelioration and/or delay of symptoms, e.g., hypercholesterolemia. Alternatively, sustained continuous release formulations of PCSK9 antagonist antibodies may be appropriate. Various formulations and devices for achieving sustained release are known in the art.                In one embodiment, dosages for an antagonist antibody, peptide, or aptamer may be determined empirically in individuals who have been given one or more administration(s) of an antagonist antibody, peptide, or aptamer. Individuals are given incremental dosages of a PCSK9 antagonist antibody, peptide, or aptamer. To assess efficacy, an indicator of the disease can be followed.                Administration of a PCSK9 antagonist antibody, peptide, or aptamer in accordance with the method in the present invention can be continuous or intermittent, depending, for example, upon the recipient's physiological condition, whether the purpose of the administration is therapeutic or prophylactic, and other factors known to skilled practitioners. The administration of a PCSK9 antagonist antibody, peptide, or aptamer may be essentially continuous over a preselected period of time or may be in a series of spaced doses.                In some embodiments, more than one antagonist antibody, peptide, or aptamer may be present. At least one, at least two, at least three, at least four, at least five different, or more antagonist antibodies and/or peptides can be present. Generally, those PCSK9 antagonist antibodies or peptides may have complementary activities that do not adversely affect each other. A PCSK9 antagonist antibody, peptide, or aptamer can also be used in conjunction with other PCSK9 antagonists or PCSK9 receptor antagonists. For example, one or more of the following PCSK9 antagonists may be used: an antisense molecule directed to a PCSK9 (including an anti-sense molecule directed to a nucleic acid encoding PCSK9), a PCSK9 inhibitory compound, and a PCSK9 structural analog. A PCSK9 antagonist antibody, peptide, or aptamer can also be used in conjunction with other agents that serve to enhance and/or complement the effectiveness of the agents.                Acceptable carriers, excipients, or stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed, and may comprise buffers such as phosphate, citrate, and other organic acids; salts such as sodium chloride; antioxidants including ascorbic acid and methionine; preservatives (such as octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride; hexamethonium chloride; benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride; phenol, butyl or benzyl alcohol; alkyl parabens, such as methyl or propyl paraben; catechol; resorcinol; cyclohexanol; 3-pentanol; and m-cresol); low molecular weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptides; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, histidine, arginine, or lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates including glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugars such as sucrose, mannitol, trehalose or sorbitol; salt-forming counter-ions such as sodium; metal complexes (e.g., Zn-protein complexes); and/or non-ionic surfactants such as TWEEN.TM., PLURONICS.TM. or polyethylene glycol (PEG).                Liposomes containing the PCSK9 antagonist antibody, peptide, or aptamer are prepared by methods known in the art, such as described in Epstein, et al., 1985, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82:3688; Hwang, et al., 1980, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77:4030; and U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,485,045 and 4,544,545. Liposomes with enhanced circulation time are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,013,556. Particularly useful liposomes can be generated by the reverse phase evaporation method with a lipid composition comprising phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol and PEG-derivatized phosphatidylethanolamine (PEG-PE). Liposomes are extruded through filters of defined pore size to yield liposomes with the desired diameter.                The active ingredients may also be entrapped in microcapsules prepared, for example, by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization, for example, hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin-microcapsules and poly-(methylmethacrylate) microcapsules, respectively, in colloidal drug delivery systems (for example, liposomes, albumin microspheres, microemulsions, nano-particles and nanocapsules) or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in Remington, The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 20th Ed., Mack Publishing (2000).                Sustained-release preparations may be prepared. Suitable examples of sustained-release preparations include semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the antibody, which matrices are in the form of shaped articles, e.g., films, or microcapsules. Examples of sustained-release matrices include polyesters, hydrogels (for example, poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate), or `poly(vinylalcohol)), polylactides (U.S. Pat. No. 3,773,919), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and 7 ethyl-L-glutamate, non-degradable ethylene-vinyl acetate, degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT.TM. (injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate), sucrose acetate isobutyrate, and poly-D-(-)-3-hydroxybutyric acid.                The formulations to be used for in vivo administration must be sterile. This is readily accomplished by, for example, filtration through sterile filtration membranes. Therapeutic PCSK9 antagonist antibody, peptide, or aptamer compositions are generally placed into a container having a sterile access port, for example, an intravenous solution bag or vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle.                Suitable emulsions may be prepared using commercially available fat emulsions, such as Intralipid.TM., Liposyn.TM., Infonutrol.TM., Lipofundin.TM. and Lipiphysan.TM.. The active ingredient may be either dissolved in a pre-mixed emulsion composition or alternatively it may be dissolved in an oil (e.g., soybean oil, safflower oil, cottonseed oil, sesame oil, corn oil or almond oil) and an emulsion formed upon mixing with a phospholipid (e.g., egg phospholipids, soybean phospholipids or soybean lecithin) and water. It will be appreciated that other ingredients may be added, for example glycerol or glucose, to adjust the tonicity of the emulsion. Suitable emulsions will typically contain up to 20% oil, for example, between 5 and 20%. The fat emulsion can comprise fat droplets between 0.1 and 1.0 .mu.m, particularly 0.1 and 0.5 .mu.m, and have a pH in the range of 5.5 to 8.0.                The emulsion compositions can be those prepared by mixing a PCSK9 antagonist antibody, peptide, or aptamer with Intralipid.TM. or the components thereof (soybean oil, egg phospholipids, glycerol and water).                Compositions for inhalation or insufflation include solutions and suspensions in pharmaceutically acceptable, aqueous or organic solvents, or mixtures thereof, and powders. The liquid or solid compositions may contain suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipients as set out above. In some embodiments, the compositions are administered by the oral or nasal respiratory route for local or systemic effect. Compositions in preferably sterile pharmaceutically acceptable solvents may be nebulised by use of gases. Nebulised solutions may be breathed directly from the nebulising device or the nebulising device may be attached to a face mask, tent or intermittent positive pressure breathing machine. Solution, suspension or powder compositions may be administered, preferably orally or nasally, from devices which deliver the formulation in an appropriate manner.                B. PCSK9 Antagonists                The methods of the invention use a PCSK9 antagonist antibody, peptide, or aptamer, which refers to any peptide or nucleic acid molecule that blocks, suppresses or reduces (including significantly reduces) PCSK9 biological activity, including downstream pathways mediated by PCSK9 signaling, such as elicitation of a cellular response to PCSK9.                A PCSK9 antagonist antibody, peptide, or aptamer should exhibit any one or more of the following characteristics: (a) bind to PCSK9; (b) block PCSK9 interaction with the LDLR; (c) block or decrease PCSK9-mediated down-regulation of the LDLR; (d) inhibit the PCSK9-mediated decrease in LDL blood clearance, (e) increase LDL clearance in media by cultured hepatocytes, (f) increase blood LDL clearance by the liver in vivo, (g) sensitize to statins, and (h) block PCSK9 interaction with other yet to be identified factors.                For purposes of this invention, the antibody, peptide, or aptamer preferably reacts with PCSK9 in a manner that inhibits PCSK9 signaling function and LDLR interaction. In some embodiments, the PCSK9 antagonist antibody specifically recognizes primate PCSK9. In some embodiments, the PCSK9 antagonist antibody binds primate and rodent PCSK9.                The antibodies useful in the present invention can encompass monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, antibody fragments (e.g., Fab, Fab', F(ab').sub.2, Fv, Fc, etc.), chimeric antibodies, bispecific antibodies, heteroconjugate antibodies, single chain (ScFv), mutants thereof, fusion proteins comprising an antibody portion (e.g., a domain antibody), human antibodies, humanized antibodies, and any other modified configuration of the immunoglobulin molecule that comprises an antigen recognition site of the required specificity, including glycosylation variants of antibodies, amino acid sequence variants of antibodies, and covalently modified antibodies. The antibodies may be murine, rat, human, or any other origin (including chimeric or humanized antibodies).                In some embodiments, the PCSK9 antagonist antibody is a monoclonal antibody. The PCSK9 antagonist antibody can also be humanized. In other embodiments, the antibody is human.                In some embodiments, the antibody comprises a modified constant region, such as a constant region that is immunologically inert, that is, having a reduced potential for provoking an immune response. In some embodiments, the constant region is modified as described in Eur. J. Immunol., 1999, 29:2613-2624; PCT Publ. No. WO99/58572; and/or UK Patent Application No. 9809951.8. The Fc can be human IgG2 or human IgG.sub.4. The Fc can be human IgG2 containing the mutation A330P331 to S330S331 (IgG.sub.2.DELTA.a), in which the amino acid residues are numbered with reference to the wild type IgG2 sequence. Eur. J. Immunol., 1999, 29:2613-2624. In some embodiments, the antibody comprises a constant region of IgG4 comprising the following mutations (Armour et al., 2003, Molecular Immunology 40 585-593): E233F234L235 to P233V234A235 (IgG.sub.4.DELTA.c), in which the numbering is with reference to wild type IgG4. In yet another embodiment, the Fc is human IgG4 E233F234L235 to P233V234A235 with deletion G236 (IgG.sub.4.DELTA.b). In another embodiment the Fc is any human IgG4 Fc (IgG.sub.4, IgG.sub.4.DELTA.b or IgG.sub.4.DELTA.c) containing hinge stabilizing mutation S228 to P228 (Aalberse et al., 2002, Immunology 105, 9-19). In another embodiment, the Fc can be aglycosylated Fc.                In some embodiments, the constant region is aglycosylated by mutating the oligosaccharide attachment residue (such as Asn297) and/or flanking residues that are part of the glycosylation recognition sequence in the constant region. In some embodiments, the constant region is aglycosylated for N-linked glycosylation enzymatically. The constant region may be aglycosylated for N-linked glycosylation enzymatically or by expression in a glycosylation deficient host cell.                The binding affinity (K.sub.D) of a PCSK9 antagonist antibody to PCSK9 (such as human PCSK9)) can be about 0.002 to about 200 nM. In some embodiments, the binding affinity is any of about 200 nM, about 100 nM, about 50 nM, about 10 nM, about 1 nM, about 500 pM, about 100 pM, about 60 pM, about 50 pM, about 20 pM, about 15 pM, about 10 pM, about 5 pM, or about 2 pM. In some embodiments, the binding affinity is less than any of about 250 nM, about 200 nM, about 100 nM, about 50 nM, about 10 nM, about 1 nM, about 500 pM, about 100 pM, about 50 pM, about 20 pM, about 10 pM, about 5 pM, or about 2 pM.                One way of determining binding affinity of antibodies to PCSK9 is by measuring binding affinity of monofunctional Fab fragments of the antibody. To obtain monofunctional Fab fragments, an antibody (for example, IgG) can be cleaved with papain or expressed recombinantly. The affinity of a PCSK9 Fab fragment of an antibody can be determined by surface plasmon resonance (Biacore3000.TM. surface plasmon resonance (SPR) system, Biacore, INC, Piscataway N.J.) equipped with pre-immobilized streptavidin sensor chips (SA) using HBS-EP running buffer (0.01M HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.15 NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.005% v/v Surfactant P20). Biotinylated human PCSK9 (or any other PCSK9) can be diluted into HBS-EP buffer to a concentration of less than 0.5 .mu.g/mL and injected across the individual chip channels using variable contact times, to achieve two ranges of antigen density, either 50-200 response units (RU) for detailed kinetic studies or 800-1,000 RU for screening assays. Regeneration studies have shown that 25 mM NaOH in 25% v/v ethanol effectively removes the bound Fab while keeping the activity of PCSK9 on the chip for over 200 injections. Typically, serial dilutions (spanning concentrations of 0.1-10.times. estimated K.sub.D) of purified Fab samples are injected for 1 min at 100 .mu.L/minute and dissociation times of up to 2 hours are allowed. The concentrations of the Fab proteins are determined by ELISA and/or SDS-PAGE electrophoresis using a Fab of known concentration (as determined by amino acid analysis) as a standard. Kinetic association rates (k.sub.on) and dissociation rates (k.sub.off) are obtained simultaneously by fitting the data globally to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model (Karlsson, R. Roos, H. Fagerstam, L. Petersson, B., 1994. Methods Enzymology 6. 99-110) using the BIAevaluation program. Equilibrium dissociation constant (K.sub.D) values are calculated as k.sub.off/k.sub.on. This protocol is suitable for use in determining binding affinity of an antibody to any PCSK9, including human PCSK9, PCSK9 of another mammalian (such as mouse PCSK9, rat PCSK9, primate PCSK9), as well as different forms of PCSK9 (such as .alpha. and .beta. form). Binding affinity of an antibody is generally measured at 25.degree. C., but can also be measured at 37.degree. C.                The PCSK9 antagonist antibodies may be made by any method known in the art including the method as provided in Example 1. The route and schedule of immunization of the host animal are generally in keeping with established and conventional techniques for antibody stimulation and production, as further described herein. General techniques for production of human and mouse antibodies are known in the art and/or are described herein. A currently preferred method of making the antibodies comprises the immunization of PCSK9.sup.- knockout (PCSK9-/-) animals as disclosed herein.                It is contemplated that any mammalian subject including humans or antibody producing cells therefrom can be manipulated to serve as the basis for production of mammalian, including human, hybridoma cell lines. Typically, the host animal is inoculated intraperitoneally, intramuscularly, orally, subcutaneously, intraplantar, and/or intradermally with an amount of immunogen, including as described herein.                Hybridomas can be prepared from the lymphocytes and immortalized myeloma cells using the general somatic cell hybridization technique of Kohler, B. and Milstein, C., 1975, Nature 256:495-497 or as modified by Buck, D. W., et al., 1982, In Vitro, 18:377-381. Available myeloma lines, including but not limited to X63-Ag8.653 and those from the Salk Institute, Cell Distribution Center, San Diego, Calif., USA, may be used in the hybridization. Generally, the technique involves fusing myeloma cells and lymphoid cells using a fusogen such as polyethylene glycol, or by electrical means well known to those skilled in the art. After the fusion, the cells are separated from the fusion medium and grown in a selective growth medium, such as hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymidine (HAT) medium, to eliminate unhybridized parent cells. Any of the media described herein, supplemented with or without serum, can be used for culturing hybridomas that secrete monoclonal antibodies. As another alternative to the cell fusion technique, EBV immortalized B cells may be used to produce the PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies of the subject invention. The hybridomas are expanded and subcloned, if desired, and supernatants are assayed for anti-immunogen activity by conventional immunoassay procedures (e.g., radioimmunoassay, enzyme immunoassay, or fluorescence immunoassay).                Hybridomas that may be used as a source of antibodies encompass all derivatives, progeny cells of the parent hybridomas that produce monoclonal antibodies specific for PCSK9, or a portion thereof.                Hybridomas that produce such antibodies may be grown in vitro or in vivo using known procedures. The monoclonal antibodies may be isolated from the culture media or body fluids, by conventional immunoglobulin purification procedures such as ammonium sulfate precipitation, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, chromatography, and ultrafiltration, if desired. Undesired activity, if present, can be removed, for example, by running the preparation over adsorbents made of the immunogen attached to a solid phase and eluting or releasing the desired antibodies off the immunogen. Immunization of a host animal with a human PCSK9, or a fragment containing the target amino acid sequence conjugated to a protein that is immunogenic in the species to be immunized, e.g., keyhole limpet hemocyanin, serum albumin, bovine thyroglobulin, or soybean trypsin inhibitor using a bifunctional or derivatizing agent, for example, maleimidobenzoyl sulfosuccinimide ester (conjugation through cysteine residues), N-hydroxysuccinimide (through lysine residues), glutaraldehyde, succinic anhydride, SOCl.sub.2, or R.sup.1N.dbd.C.dbd.NR, where R and R.sup.1 are different alkyl groups, can yield a population of antibodies (e.g., monoclonal antibodies).                If desired, the PCSK9 antagonist antibody (monoclonal or polyclonal) of interest may be sequenced and the polynucleotide sequence may then be cloned into a vector for expression or propagation. The sequence encoding the antibody of interest may be maintained in vector in a host cell and the host cell can then be expanded and frozen for future use. Production of recombinant monoclonal antibodies in cell culture can be carried out through cloning of antibody genes from B cells by means known in the art. See, e.g., Tiller et al., 2008, J. Immunol. Methods 329, 112; U.S. Pat. No. 7,314,622.                In an alternative, the polynucleotide sequence may be used for genetic manipulation to \"humanize\" the antibody or to improve the affinity, or other characteristics of the antibody. For example, the constant region may be engineered to more nearly resemble human constant regions to avoid immune response if the antibody is used in clinical trials and treatments in humans. It may be desirable to genetically manipulate the antibody sequence to obtain greater affinity to PCSK9 and greater efficacy in inhibiting PCSK9. It will be apparent to one of skill in the art that one or more polynucleotide changes can be made to the PCSK9 antagonist antibody and still maintain its binding ability to PCSK9.                There are four general steps to humanize a monoclonal antibody. These are: (1) determining the nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequence of the starting antibody light and heavy variable domains; (2) designing the humanized antibody, i.e., deciding which antibody framework region to use during the humanizing process; (3) the actual humanizing methodologies/techniques; and (4) the transfection and expression of the humanized antibody. See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,816,567; 5,807,715; 5,866,692; 6,331,415; 5,530,101; 5,693,761; 5,693,762; 5,585,089; and 6,180,370.                A number of \"humanized\" antibody molecules comprising an antigen-binding site derived from a non-human immunoglobulin have been described, including chimeric antibodies having rodent or modified rodent V regions and their associated CDRs fused to human constant domains. See, for example, Winter et al., 1991, Nature 349:293-299; Lobuglio et al., 1989, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 86:4220-4224; Shaw et al., 1987, J Immunol. 138:4534-4538; and Brown et al., 1987, Cancer Res. 47:3577-3583. Other references describe rodent CDRs grafted into a human supporting framework region (FR) prior to fusion with an appropriate human antibody constant domain. See, for example, Riechmann et al., 1988, Nature 332:323-327; Verhoeyen et al., 1988, Science 239:1534-1536; and Jones et al., 1986, Nature 321:522-525. Another reference describes rodent CDRs supported by recombinantly engineered rodent framework regions. See, for example, European Patent Publ. No. 0519596. These \"humanized\" molecules are designed to minimize unwanted immunological response toward rodent anti-human antibody molecules which limits the duration and effectiveness of therapeutic applications of those moieties in human recipients. For example, the antibody constant region can be engineered such that it is immunologically inert (e.g., does not trigger complement lysis). See, e.g., PCT Publ. No. WO99/58572; UK Patent Application No. 9809951.8. Other methods of humanizing antibodies that may also be utilized are disclosed by Daugherty et al., 1991, Nucl. Acids Res. 19:2471-2476 and in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,180,377; 6,054,297; 5,997,867; 5,866,692; 6,210,671; and 6,350,861; and in PCT Publ. No. WO 01/27160.                In yet another alternative, fully human antibodies may be obtained by using commercially available mice that have been engineered to express specific human immunoglobulin proteins. Transgenic animals that are designed to produce a more desirable or more robust immune response may also be used for generation of humanized or human antibodies. Examples of such technology are Xenomouse.TM. from Abgenix, Inc. (Fremont, Calif.), HuMAb-Mouse.RTM. and TC Mouse.TM. from Medarex, Inc. (Princeton, N.J.), and the VelocImmune.RTM. mouse from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Tarrytown, N.Y.).                In an alternative, antibodies may be made recombinantly and expressed using any method known in the art. In another alternative, antibodies may be made recombinantly by phage display technology. See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,565,332; 5,580,717; 5,733,743; and 6,265,150; and Winter et al., 1994, Annu. Rev. Immunol. 12:433-455. Alternatively, the phage display technology (McCafferty et al., 1990, Nature 348:552-553) can be used to produce human antibodies and antibody fragments in vitro, from immunoglobulin variable (V) domain gene repertoires from unimmunized donors. According to this technique, antibody V domain genes are cloned in-frame into either a major or minor coat protein gene of a filamentous bacteriophage, such as M13 or fd, and displayed as functional antibody fragments on the surface of the phage particle. Because the filamentous particle contains a single-stranded DNA copy of the phage genome, selections based on the functional properties of the antibody also result in selection of the gene encoding the antibody exhibiting those properties. Thus, the phage mimics some of the properties of the B cell. Phage display can be performed in a variety of formats; see, e.g., Johnson, Kevin S, and Chiswell, David J., 1993, Current Opinion in Structural Biology 3:564-571. Several sources of V-gene segments can be used for phage display. Clackson et al., 1991, Nature 352:624-628 isolated a diverse array of anti-oxazolone antibodies from a small random combinatorial library of V genes derived from the spleens of immunized mice. A repertoire of V genes from unimmunized human donors can be constructed and antibodies to a diverse array of antigens (including self-antigens) can be isolated essentially following the techniques described by Mark et al., 1991, J. Mol. Biol. 222:581-597, or Griffith et al., 1993, EMBO J. 12:725-734. In a natural immune response, antibody genes accumulate mutations at a high rate (somatic hypermutation). Some of the changes introduced will confer higher affinity, and B cells displaying high-affinity surface immunoglobulin are preferentially replicated and differentiated during subsequent antigen challenge. This natural process can be mimicked by employing the technique known as \"chain shuffling.\" (Marks et al., 1992, Bio/Technol. 10:779-783). In this method, the affinity of \"primary\" human antibodies obtained by phage display can be improved by sequentially replacing the heavy and light chain V region genes with repertoires of naturally occurring variants (repertoires) of V domain genes obtained from unimmunized donors. This technique allows the production of antibodies and antibody fragments with affinities in the pM-nM range. A strategy for making very large phage antibody repertoires (also known as \"the mother-of-all libraries\") has been described by Waterhouse et al., 1993, Nucl. Acids Res. 21:2265-2266. Gene shuffling can also be used to derive human antibodies from rodent antibodies, where the human antibody has similar affinities and specificities to the starting rodent antibody. According to this method, which is also referred to as \"epitope imprinting\", the heavy or light chain V domain gene of rodent antibodies obtained by phage display technique is replaced with a repertoire of human V domain genes, creating rodent-human chimeras. Selection on antigen results in isolation of human variable regions capable of restoring a functional antigen-binding site, i.e., the epitope governs (imprints) the choice of partner. When the process is repeated in order to replace the remaining rodent V domain, a human antibody is obtained (see PCT Publ. No. WO 93/06213). Unlike traditional humanization of rodent antibodies by CDR grafting, this technique provides completely human antibodies, which have no framework or CDR residues of rodent origin.                It is apparent that although the above discussion pertains to humanized antibodies, the general principles discussed are applicable to customizing antibodies for use, for example, in dogs, cats, primate, equines and bovines. It is further apparent that one or more aspects of humanizing an antibody described herein may be combined, e.g., CDR grafting, framework mutation and CDR mutation.                Antibodies may be made recombinantly by first isolating the antibodies and antibody producing cells from host animals, obtaining the gene sequence, and using the gene sequence to express the antibody recombinantly in host cells (e.g., CHO cells). Another method which may be employed is to express the antibody sequence in plants (e.g., tobacco) or transgenic milk. Methods for expressing antibodies recombinantly in plants or milk have been disclosed. See, for example, Peeters, 2001, et al. Vaccine 19:2756; Lonberg, N. and D. Huszar, 1995, Int. Rev. Immunol 13:65; and Pollock, et al., 1999, J Immunol Methods 231:147. Methods for making derivatives of antibodies, e.g., humanized, single chain, etc. are known in the art.                Immunoassays and flow cytometry sorting techniques such as fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) can also be employed to isolate antibodies that are specific for PCSK9.                The antibodies can be bound to many different carriers. Carriers can be active and/or inert. Examples of well-known carriers include polypropylene, polystyrene, polyethylene, dextran, nylon, amylases, glass, natural and modified celluloses, polyacrylamides, agaroses and magnetite. The nature of the carrier can be either soluble or insoluble for purposes of the invention. Those skilled in the art will know of other suitable carriers for binding antibodies, or will be able to ascertain such, using routine experimentation. In some embodiments, the carrier comprises a moiety that targets the myocardium.                DNA encoding the monoclonal antibodies is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of the monoclonal antibodies). The hybridoma cells serve as a preferred source of such DNA. Once isolated, the DNA may be placed into expression vectors (such as expression vectors disclosed in PCT Publ. No. WO 87/04462), which are then transfected into host cells such as E. coli cells, simian COS cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, or myeloma cells that do not otherwise produce immunoglobulin protein, to obtain the synthesis of monoclonal antibodies in the recombinant host cells. See, e.g., PCT Publ. No. WO 87/04462. The DNA also may be modified, for example, by substituting the coding sequence for human heavy and light chain constant domains in place of the homologous murine sequences, Morrison et al., 1984, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 81:6851, or by covalently joining to the immunoglobulin coding sequence all or part of the coding sequence for a non-immunoglobulin polypeptide. In that manner, \"chimeric\" or \"hybrid\" antibodies are prepared that have the binding specificity of a PCSK9 monoclonal antibody herein.                PCSK9 antagonist antibodies and polypeptides derived from antibodies can be identified or characterized using methods known in the art, whereby reduction, amelioration, or neutralization of PCSK9 biological activity is detected and/or measured. In some embodiments, a PCSK9 antagonist antibody or polypeptide is identified by incubating a candidate agent with PCSK9 and monitoring binding and/or attendant reduction or neutralization of a biological activity of PCSK9. The binding assay may be performed with purified PCSK9 polypeptide(s), or with cells naturally expressing, or transfected to express, PCSK9 polypeptide(s). In one embodiment, the binding assay is a competitive binding assay, where the ability of a candidate antibody to compete with a known PCSK9 antagonist for PCSK9 binding is evaluated. The assay may be performed in various formats, including the ELISA format. In other embodiments, a PCSK9 antagonist antibody is identified by incubating a candidate agent with PCSK9 and monitoring binding and attendant inhibition of LDLR expression and/or blood cholesterol clearance.                Following initial identification, the activity of a candidate PCSK9 antagonist antibody can be further confirmed and refined by bioassays that are known to test the targeted biological activities. Alternatively, bioassays can be used to screen candidates directly. Some of the methods for identifying and characterizing PCSK9 antagonist antibodies, peptides, or aptamers are described in detail in the Examples.                PCSK9 antagonist antibodies may be characterized using methods well known in the art. For example, one method is to identify the epitope to which it binds, or \"epitope mapping.\" There are many methods known in the art for mapping and characterizing the location of epitopes on proteins, including solving the crystal structure of an antibody-antigen complex, competition assays, gene fragment expression assays, and synthetic peptide-based assays, as described, for example, in Chapter 11 of Harlow and Lane, Using Antibodies, a Laboratory Manual, (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1999). In an additional example, epitope mapping can be used to determine the sequence to which a PCSK9 antagonist antibody binds. Epitope mapping is commercially available from various sources, for example, Pepscan Systems (Edelhertweg 15, 8219 PH Lelystad, The Netherlands). The epitope can be a linear epitope, i.e., contained in a single stretch of amino acids, or a conformational epitope formed by a three-dimensional interaction of amino acids that may not necessarily be contained in a single stretch. Peptides of varying lengths (e.g., at least 4-6 amino acids long) can be isolated or synthesized (e.g., recombinantly) and used for binding assays with a PCSK9 antagonist antibody. In another example, the epitope to which the PCSK9 antagonist antibody binds can be determined in a systematic screening by using overlapping peptides derived from the PCSK9 sequence and determining binding by the PCSK9 antagonist antibody. According to the gene fragment expression assays, the open reading frame encoding PCSK9 is fragmented either randomly or by specific genetic constructions and the reactivity of the expressed fragments of PCSK9 with the antibody to be tested is determined. The gene fragments may, for example, be produced by PCR and then transcribed and translated into protein in vitro, in the presence of radioactive amino acids. The binding of the antibody to the radioactively labeled PCSK9 fragments is then determined by immunoprecipitation and gel electrophoresis. Certain epitopes can also be identified by using large libraries of random peptide sequences displayed on the surface of phage particles (phage libraries). Alternatively, a defined library of overlapping peptide fragments can be tested for binding to the test antibody in simple binding assays. In an additional example, mutagenesis of an antigen binding domain, domain swapping experiments and alanine scanning mutagenesis can be performed to identify residues required, sufficient, and/or necessary for epitope binding. For example, domain swapping experiments can be performed using a mutant PCSK9 in which various fragments of the PCSK9 polypeptide have been replaced (swapped) with sequences from PCSK9 from another species, or a closely related, but antigenically distinct protein (such as another member of the proprotein convertase family). By assessing binding of the antibody to the mutant PCSK9, the importance of the particular PCSK9 fragment to antibody binding can be assessed.                Yet another method which can be used to characterize a PCSK9 antagonist antibody is to use competition assays with other antibodies known to bind to the same antigen, i.e., various fragments on PCSK9, to determine if the PCSK9 antagonist antibody binds to the same epitope as other antibodies. Competition assays are well known to those of skill in the art.                The crystal structure of the antibody and antibody:antigen complex can also be used to characterize the antibody. The residues are identified by calculating the difference in accessible surface area between the L1L3:PCSK9 crystal structure and PCSK9 structure alone. PCSK9 residues that show buried surface area upon complex formation with L1L3 antibody are included as a part of the epitope. The solvent accessible surface of a protein is defined as the locus of the centre of a probe sphere (representing a solvent molecule of 1.4 .ANG. radius) as it rolls over the Van der Waals surface of the protein. The solvent accessible surface area is calculated by generating surface points on an extended sphere about each atom (at a distance from the atom centre equal to the sum of the atom and probe radii), and eliminating those that lie within equivalent spheres associated with neighboring atoms as implemented in program AREAIMOL (Briggs, P. J., 2000, CCP4 Newsletter No. 38, CCLRC, Daresbury).                An expression vector can be used to direct expression of a PCSK9 antagonist antibody. One skilled in the art is familiar with administration of expression vectors to obtain expression of an exogenous protein in vivo. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,436,908; 6,413,942; and 6,376,471. Administration of expression vectors includes local or systemic administration, including injection, oral administration, particle gun or catheterized administration, and topical administration. In another embodiment, the expression vector is administered directly to the sympathetic trunk or ganglion, or into a coronary artery, atrium, ventrical, or pericardium.                Targeted delivery of therapeutic compositions containing an expression vector, or subgenomic polynucleotides can also be used. Receptor-mediated DNA delivery techniques are described in, for example, Findeis et al., 1993, Trends Biotechnol. 11:202; Chiou et al., 1994, Gene Therapeutics: Methods And Applications Of Direct Gene Transfer (J. A. Wolff, ed.); Wu et al., 1988, J. Biol. Chem. 263:621; Wu et al., 1994, J. Biol. Chem. 269:542; Zenke et al., 1990, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87:3655; Wu et al., 1991, J. Biol. Chem. 266:338. Therapeutic compositions containing a polynucleotide are administered in a range of about 100 ng to about 200 mg of DNA for local administration in a gene therapy protocol. Concentration ranges of about 500 ng to about 50 mg, about 1 .mu.g to about 2 mg, about 5 .mu.g to about 500 .mu.g, and about 20 .mu.g to about 100 .mu.g of DNA can also be used during a gene therapy protocol. The therapeutic polynucleotides and polypeptides can be delivered using gene delivery vehicles. The gene delivery vehicle can be of viral or non-viral origin (see generally, Jolly, 1994, Cancer Gene Therapy 1:51; Kimura, 1994, Human Gene Therapy 5:845; Connelly, 1995, Human Gene Therapy 1:185; and Kaplitt, 1994, Nature Genetics 6:148). Expression of such coding sequences can be induced using endogenous mammalian or heterologous promoters. Expression of the coding sequence can be either constitutive or regulated.                Viral-based vectors for delivery of a desired polynucleotide and expression in a desired cell are well known in the art. Exemplary viral-based vehicles include, but are not limited to, recombinant retroviruses (see, e.g., PCT Publ. Nos. WO 90/07936; WO 94/03622; WO 93/25698; WO 93/25234; WO 93/11230; WO 93/10218; WO 91/02805; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,219,740 and 4,777,127; GB Patent No. 2,200,651; and EP Patent No. 0 345 242), alphavirus-based vectors (e.g., Sindbis virus vectors, Semliki forest virus (ATCC VR-67; ATCC VR-1247), Ross River virus (ATCC VR-373; ATCC VR-1246) and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (ATCC VR-923; ATCC VR-1250; ATCC VR 1249; ATCC VR-532)), and adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors (see, e.g., PCT Publ. Nos. WO 94/12649, WO 93/03769; WO 93/19191; WO 94/28938; WO 95/11984 and WO 95/00655). Administration of DNA linked to killed adenovirus as described in Curiel, 1992, Hum. Gene Ther. 3:147, can also be employed.                Non-viral delivery vehicles and methods can also be employed, including, but not limited to, polycationic condensed DNA linked or unlinked to killed adenovirus alone (see, e.g., Curiel, 1992, Hum. Gene Ther. 3:147); ligand-linked DNA (see, e.g., Wu, J., 1989, Biol. Chem. 264:16985); eukaryotic cell delivery vehicles cells (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,814,482; PCT Publ. Nos. WO 95/07994; WO 96/17072; WO 95/30763; and WO 97/42338) and nucleic charge neutralization or fusion with cell membranes. Naked DNA can also be employed. Exemplary naked DNA introduction methods are described in PCT Publ. No. WO 90/11092 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,580,859. Liposomes that can act as gene delivery vehicles are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,422,120; PCT Publ. Nos. WO 95/13796; WO 94/23697; WO 91/14445; and EP 0524968. Additional approaches are described in Philip, 1994, Mol. Cell. Biol., 14:2411, and in Woffendin, 1994 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 91:1581.                This invention encompasses compositions, including pharmaceutical compositions, comprising antibodies described herein or made by the methods and having the characteristics described herein. As used herein, compositions comprise one or more antibodies, peptides, or aptamers that antagonize the interaction of PCSK9 with the LDLR, and/or one or more polynucleotides comprising sequences encoding one or more these antibodies or peptides. These compositions may further comprise suitable excipients, such as pharmaceutically acceptable excipients including buffers, which are well known in the art.                The PCSK9 antagonist antibodies and peptides of the invention are characterized by any (one or more) of the following characteristics: (a) bind to PCSK9; (b) block PCSK9 interaction with the LDLR; (c) decrease PCSK9-mediated down-regulation of the LDLR; and (d) inhibit PCSK9-mediated inhibition of LDL blood clearance. Preferably, PCSK9 antibodies have two or more of these features. More preferably, the antibodies have three or more of the features. Most preferably, the antibodies have all four characteristics.                Accordingly, the invention provides any of the following, or compositions (including pharmaceutical compositions) comprising any antibody having a partial light chain sequence and a partial heavy chain sequence as found in Table 1. The underlined sequences are CDR sequences according to Kabat and in bold according to Chothia.

Determination of CDR regions is well within the skill of the art. It is understood that in some embodiments, CDRs can be a combination of the Kabat and Chothia CDR (also termed \"combined CDRs\" or \"extended CDRs\"). In some embodiments, the CDRs are the Kabat CDRs. In other embodiments, the CDRs are the Chothia CDRs. In other words, in embodiments with more than one CDR, the CDRs may be any of Kabat, Chothia, combination CDRs, or combinations thereof.                The invention also provides methods of making any of these antibodies or polypeptides. The antibodies of this invention can be made by procedures known in the art. The polypeptides can be produced by proteolytic or other degradation of the antibodies, by recombinant methods (i.e., single or fusion polypeptides) as described above or by chemical synthesis. Polypeptides of the antibodies, especially shorter polypeptides up to about 50 amino acids, are conveniently made by chemical synthesis. Methods of chemical synthesis are known in the art and are commercially available. For example, an antibody could be produced by an automated polypeptide synthesizer employing the solid phase method. See also, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,807,715; 4,816,567; and 6,331,415.                In another alternative, the antibodies and peptides can be made recombinantly using procedures that are well known in the art. In one embodiment, a polynucleotide comprises a sequence encoding the heavy chain and/or the light chain variable regions of antibody 4A5, 5A10, 6F6, 7D4 or L1L3. The sequence encoding the antibody of interest may be maintained in a vector in a host cell and the host cell can then be expanded and frozen for future use. Vectors (including expression vectors) and host cells are further described herein.                The invention also encompasses scFv of antibodies of this invention. Single chain variable region fragments are made by linking light and/or heavy chain variable regions by using a short linking peptide. Bird et al., 1988, Science 242:423-426. An example of a linking peptide is (GGGGS).sub.3 (SEQ ID NO:24), which bridges approximately 3.5 nm between the carboxy terminus of one variable region and the amino terminus of the other variable region. Linkers of other sequences have been designed and used. Bird et al., 1988, supra. Linkers should be short, flexible polypeptides and preferably comprised of less than about 20 amino acid residues. Linkers can in turn be modified for additional functions, such as attachment of drugs or attachment to solid supports. The single chain variants can be produced either recombinantly or synthetically. For synthetic production of scFv, an automated synthesizer can be used. For recombinant production of scFv, a suitable plasmid containing polynucleotide that encodes the scFv can be introduced into a suitable host cell, either eukaryotic, such as yeast, plant, insect or mammalian cells, or prokaryotic, such as E. coli. Polynucleotides encoding the scFv of interest can be made by routine manipulations such as ligation of polynucleotides. The resultant scFv can be isolated using standard protein purification techniques known in the art.                Other forms of single chain antibodies, such as diabodies are also encompassed. Diabodies are bivalent, bispecific antibodies in which VH and VL domains are expressed on a single polypeptide chain, but using a linker that is too short to allow for pairing between the two domains on the same chain, thereby forcing the domains to pair with complementary domains of another chain and creating two antigen binding sites (see e.g., Holliger, P., et al., 1993, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:6444-6448; Poljak, R. J., et al., 1994, Structure 2:1121-1123).                For example, bispecific antibodies, monoclonal antibodies that have binding specificities for at least two different antigens, can be prepared using the antibodies disclosed herein. Methods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art (see, e.g., Suresh et al., 1986, Methods in Enzymology 121:210). Traditionally, the recombinant production of bispecific antibodies was based on the coexpression of two immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pairs, with the two heavy chains having different specificities (Millstein and Cuello, 1983, Nature 305, 537-539).                According to one approach to making bispecific antibodies, antibody variable domains with the desired binding specificities (antibody-antigen combining sites) are fused to immunoglobulin constant domain sequences. The fusion preferably is with an immunoglobulin heavy chain constant domain, comprising at least part of the hinge, CH2 and CH3 regions. It is preferred to have the first heavy chain constant region (CH1), containing the site necessary for light chain binding, present in at least one of the fusions. DNAs encoding the immunoglobulin heavy chain fusions and, if desired, the immunoglobulin light chain, are inserted into separate expression vectors, and are cotransfected into a suitable host organism. This provides for great flexibility in adjusting the mutual proportions of the three polypeptide fragments in embodiments when unequal ratios of the three polypeptide chains used in the construction provide the optimum yields. It is, however, possible to insert the coding sequences for two or all three polypeptide chains in one expression vector when the expression of at least two polypeptide chains in equal ratios results in high yields or when the ratios are of no particular significance.                In one approach, the bispecific antibodies are composed of a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain with a first binding specificity in one arm, and a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pair (providing a second binding specificity) in the other arm. This asymmetric structure, with an immunoglobulin light chain in only one half of the bispecific molecule, facilitates the separation of the desired bispecific compound from unwanted immunoglobulin chain combinations. This approach is described in PCT Publ. No. WO 94/04690.                Heteroconjugate antibodies, comprising two covalently joined antibodies, are also within the scope of the invention. Such antibodies have been used to target immune system cells to unwanted cells (U.S. Pat. No. 4,676,980), and for treatment of HIV infection (PCT Publ. Nos. WO 91/00360 and WO 92/200373; EP 03089). Heteroconjugate antibodies may be made using any convenient cross-linking methods. Suitable cross-linking agents and techniques are well known in the art, and are described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,676,980.                Chimeric or hybrid antibodies also may be prepared in vitro using known methods of synthetic protein chemistry, including those involving cross-linking agents. For example, immunotoxins may be constructed using a disulfide exchange reaction or by forming a thioether bond. Examples of suitable reagents for this purpose include iminothiolate and methyl-4-mercaptobutyrimidate.                Humanized antibody comprising one or more CDRs of antibodies 5A10 or 7D4 or one or more CDRs derived from antibodies 5A10 or 7D4 can be made, for example, using any methods know in the art. For example, four general steps may be used to humanize a monoclonal antibody. These are: (1) determining the nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequence of the starting antibody light and heavy variable domains; (2) designing the humanized antibody, i.e., deciding which antibody framework region to use during the humanizing process; (3) using the actual humanizing methodologies/techniques; and (4) transfecting and expressing the humanized antibody. See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,816,567; 5,807,715; 5,866,692; 6,331,415; 5,530,101; 5,693,761; 5,693,762; 5,585,089; and 6,180,370.                In the recombinant humanized antibodies, the Fc portion can be modified to avoid interaction with Fc.gamma. receptor and the complement and immune systems. The techniques for preparation of such antibodies are described in WO 99/58572. For example, the constant region may be engineered to more resemble human constant regions to avoid immune response if the antibody is used in clinical trials and treatments in humans. See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,997,867 and 5,866,692.                Humanized antibody comprising the light or heavy chain variable regions or one or more CDRs of an antibody or its variants shown in Table 1, or one or more CDRs derived from the antibody or its variants shown in Table 2 can be made using any methods known in the art.                Humanized antibodies may be made by any method known in the art.                The invention encompasses modifications to the antibodies and polypeptides of the invention variants shown in Table 1, including functionally equivalent antibodies which do not significantly affect their properties and variants which have enhanced or decreased activity and/or affinity. For example, the amino acid sequence may be mutated to obtain an antibody with the desired binding affinity to PCSK9. Modification of polypeptides is routine practice in the art and need not be described in detail herein. Modification of polypeptides is exemplified in the Examples. Examples of modified polypeptides include polypeptides with conservative substitutions of amino acid residues, one or more deletions or additions of amino acids which do not significantly deleteriously change the functional activity, or which mature (enhance) the affinity of the polypeptide for its ligand, or use of chemical analogs.                Amino acid sequence insertions include amino- and/or carboxyl-terminal fusions ranging in length from one residue to polypeptides containing a hundred or more residues, as well as intrasequence insertions of single or multiple amino acid residues. Examples of terminal insertions include an antibody with an N-terminal methionyl residue or the antibody fused to an epitope tag. Other insertional variants of the antibody molecule include the fusion to the N- or C-terminus of the antibody of an enzyme or a polypeptide which increases the half-life of the antibody in the blood circulation.                Substitution variants have at least one amino acid residue in the antibody molecule removed and a different residue inserted in its place. The sites of greatest interest for substitutional mutagenesis include the hypervariable regions, but FR alterations are also contemplated. Conservative substitutions are shown in Table 2 under the heading of \"conservative substitutions.\" If such substitutions result in a change in biological activity, then more substantial changes, denominated \"exemplary substitutions\" in Table 2, or as further described below in reference to amino acid classes, may be introduced and the products screened.                TABLE-US-00002 TABLE 2 Amino Acid Substitutions Original Conservative Exemplary Residue Substitutions Substitutions Ala (A) Val Val; Leu; Ile Arg (R) Lys Lys; Gln; Asn Asn (N) Gln Gln; His; Asp, Lys; Arg Asp (D) Glu Glu; Asn Cys (C) Ser Ser; Ala Gln (Q) Asn Asn; Glu Glu (E) Asp Asp; Gln Gly (G) Ala Ala His (H) Arg Asn; Gln; Lys; Arg Ile (I) Leu Leu; Val; Met; Ala; Phe; Norleucine Leu (L) Ile Norleucine; Ile; Val; Met; Ala; Phe Lys (K) Arg Arg; Gln; Asn Met (M) Leu Leu; Phe; Ile Phe (F) Tyr Leu; Val; Ile; Ala; Tyr Pro (P) Ala Ala Ser (S) Thr Thr Thr (T) Ser Ser Trp (W) Tyr Tyr; Phe Tyr (Y) Phe Trp; Phe; Thr; Ser Val (V) Leu Ile; Leu; Met; Phe; Ala; Norleucine                Substantial modifications in the biological properties of the antibody are accomplished by selecting substitutions that differ significantly in their effect on maintaining (a) the structure of the polypeptide backbone in the area of the substitution, for example, as a sheet or helical conformation, (b) the charge or hydrophobicity of the molecule at the target site, or (c) the bulk of the side chain. Naturally occurring residues are divided into groups based on common side-chain properties: (1) Non-polar: Norleucine, Met, Ala, Val, Leu, Ile; (2) Polar without charge: Cys, Ser, Thr, Asn, Gln; (3) Acidic (negatively charged): Asp, Glu; (4) Basic (positively charged): Lys, Arg; (5) Residues that influence chain orientation: Gly, Pro; and (6) Aromatic: Trp, Tyr, Phe, His.                Non-conservative substitutions are made by exchanging a member of one of these classes for another class.                Any cysteine residue not involved in maintaining the proper conformation of the antibody also may be substituted, generally with serine, to improve the oxidative stability of the molecule and prevent aberrant cross-linking. Conversely, cysteine bond(s) may be added to the antibody to improve its stability, particularly where the antibody is an antibody fragment such as an Fv fragment.                Amino acid modifications can range from changing or modifying one or more amino acids to complete redesign of a region, such as the variable region. Changes in the variable region can alter binding affinity and/or specificity. In some embodiments, no more than one to five conservative amino acid substitutions are made within a CDR domain. In other embodiments, no more than one to three conservative amino acid substitutions are made within a CDR domain. In still other embodiments, the CDR domain is CDR H3 and/or CDR L3.                Modifications also include glycosylated and nonglycosylated polypeptides, as well as polypeptides with other post-translational modifications, such as, for example, glycosylation with different sugars, acetylation, and phosphorylation. Antibodies are glycosylated at conserved positions in their constant regions (Jefferis and Lund, 1997, Chem. Immunol. 65:111-128; Wright and Morrison, 1997, TibTECH 15:26-32). The oligosaccharide side chains of the immunoglobulins affect the protein's function (Boyd et al., 1996, Mol. Immunol. 32:1311-1318; Wittwe and Howard, 1990, Biochem. 29:4175-4180) and the intramolecular interaction between portions of the glycoprotein, which can affect the conformation and presented three-dimensional surface of the glycoprotein (Jefferis and Lund, supra; Wyss and Wagner, 1996, Current Opin. Biotech. 7:409-416). Oligosaccharides may also serve to target a given glycoprotein to certain molecules based upon specific recognition structures. Glycosylation of antibodies has also been reported to affect antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). In particular, CHO cells with tetracycline-regulated expression of .beta.(1,4)--N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III (GnTIII), a glycosyltransferase catalyzing formation of bisecting GlcNAc, was reported to have improved ADCC activity (Umana et al., 1999, Nature Biotech. 17:176-180).                Glycosylation of antibodies is typically either N-linked or O-linked. N-linked refers to the attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the side chain of an asparagine residue. The tripeptide sequences asparagine-X-serine, asparagine-X-threonine, and asparagine-X-cysteine, where X is any amino acid except proline, are the recognition sequences for enzymatic attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the asparagine side chain. Thus, the presence of either of these tripeptide sequences in a polypeptide creates a potential glycosylation site. O-linked glycosylation refers to the attachment of one of the sugars N-acetylgalactosamine, galactose, or xylose to a hydroxyamino acid, most commonly serine or threonine, although 5-hydroxyproline or 5-hydroxylysine may also be used.                Addition of glycosylation sites to the antibody is conveniently accomplished by altering the amino acid sequence such that it contains one or more of the above-described tripeptide sequences (for N-linked glycosylation sites). The alteration may also be made by the addition of, or substitution by, one or more serine or threonine residues to the sequence of the original antibody (for O-linked glycosylation sites).                The glycosylation pattern of antibodies may also be altered without altering the underlying nucleotide sequence. Glycosylation largely depends on the host cell used to express the antibody. Since the cell type used for expression of recombinant glycoproteins, e.g., antibodies, as potential therapeutics is rarely the native cell, variations in the glycosylation pattern of the antibodies can be expected (see, e.g., Hse et al., 1997, J. Biol. Chem. 272:9062-9070).                In addition to the choice of host cells, factors that affect glycosylation during recombinant production of antibodies include growth mode, media formulation, culture density, oxygenation, pH, purification schemes and the like. Various methods have been proposed to alter the glycosylation pattern achieved in a particular host organism including introducing or overexpressing certain enzymes involved in oligosaccharide production (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,047,335; 5,510,261 and 5,278,299). Glycosylation, or certain types of glycosylation, can be enzymatically removed from the glycoprotein, for example, using endoglycosidase H (Endo H), N-glycosidase F, endoglycosidase F1, endoglycosidase F2, endoglycosidase F3. In addition, the recombinant host cell can be genetically engineered to be defective in processing certain types of polysaccharides. These and similar techniques are well known in the art.                Other methods of modification include using coupling techniques known in the art, including, but not limited to, enzymatic means, oxidative substitution and chelation. Modifications can be used, for example, for attachment of labels for immunoassay. Modified polypeptides are made using established procedures in the art and can be screened using standard assays known in the art, some of which are described below and in the Examples.                In some embodiments of the invention, the antibody comprises a modified constant region, such as a constant region that is immunologically inert or partially inert, e.g., does not trigger complement mediated lysis, does not stimulate ADCC, or does not activate microglia; or have reduced activities (compared to the unmodified antibody) in any one or more of the following: triggering complement mediated lysis, stimulating ADCC, or activating microglia. Different modifications of the constant region may be used to achieve optimal level and/or combination of effector functions. See, for example, Morgan et al., 1995, Immunology 86:319-324; Lund et al., 1996, J. Immunology 157:4963-9 157:4963-4969; Idusogie et al., 2000, J. Immunology 164:4178-4184; Tao et al., 1989, J. Immunology 143: 2595-2601; and Jefferis et al., 1998, Immunological Reviews 163:59-76. In some embodiments, the constant region is modified as described in Eur. J. Immunol., 1999, 29:2613-2624; PCT Publ. No. WO99/58572; and/or UK Patent Application No. 9809951.8. In other embodiments, the antibody comprises a human heavy chain IgG2 constant region comprising the following mutations: A330P331 to S330S331 (amino acid numbering with reference to the wild type IgG2 sequence). Eur. J. Immunol., 1999, 29:2613-2624. In still other embodiments, the constant region is aglycosylated for N-linked glycosylation. In some embodiments, the constant region is aglycosylated for N-linked glycosylation by mutating the glycosylated amino acid residue or flanking residues that are part of the N-glycosylation recognition sequence in the constant region. For example, N-glycosylation site N297 may be mutated to A, Q, K, or H. See, Tao et al., 1989, J. Immunology 143: 2595-2601; and Jefferis et al., 1998, Immunological Reviews 163:59-76. In some embodiments, the constant region is aglycosylated for N-linked glycosylation. The constant region may be aglycosylated for N-linked glycosylation enzymatically (such as removing carbohydrate by enzyme PNGase), or by expression in a glycosylation deficient host cell.                Other antibody modifications include antibodies that have been modified as described in PCT Publ. No. WO 99/58572. These antibodies comprise, in addition to a binding domain directed at the target molecule, an effector domain having an amino acid sequence substantially homologous to all or part of a constant domain of a human immunoglobulin heavy chain. These antibodies are capable of binding the target molecule without triggering significant complement dependent lysis, or cell-mediated destruction of the target. In some embodiments, the effector domain is capable of specifically binding FcRn and/or Fc.gamma.RIIb. These are typically based on chimeric domains derived from two or more human immunoglobulin heavy chain C.sub.H2 domains. Antibodies modified in this manner are particularly suitable for use in chronic antibody therapy, to avoid inflammatory and other adverse reactions to conventional antibody therapy.                The invention includes affinity matured embodiments. For example, affinity matured antibodies can be produced by procedures known in the art (Marks et al., 1992, Bio/Technology, 10:779-783; Barbas et al., 1994, Proc Nat. Acad. Sci, USA 91:3809-3813; Schier et al., 1995, Gene, 169:147-155; Yelton et al., 1995, J. Immunol., 155:1994-2004; Jackson et al., 1995, J. Immunol., 154(7):3310-9; Hawkins et al., 1992, J. Mol. Biol., 226:889-896; and PCT Publ. No. WO2004/058184).                The following methods may be used for adjusting the affinity of an antibody and for characterizing a CDR. One way of characterizing a CDR of an antibody and/or altering (such as improving) the binding affinity of a polypeptide, such as an antibody, termed \"library scanning mutagenesis\". Generally, library scanning mutagenesis works as follows. One or more amino acid positions in the CDR are replaced with two or more (such as 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20) amino acids using art recognized methods. This generates small libraries of clones (in some embodiments, one for every amino acid position that is analyzed), each with a complexity of two or more members (if two or more amino acids are substituted at every position). Generally, the library also includes a clone comprising the native (unsubstituted) amino acid. A small number of clones, e.g., about 20-80 clones (depending on the complexity of the library), from each library are screened for binding affinity to the target polypeptide (or other binding target), and candidates with increased, the same, decreased, or no binding are identified. Methods for determining binding affinity are well-known in the art. Binding affinity may be determined using Biacore surface plasmon resonance analysis, which detects differences in binding affinity of about 2-fold or greater. Biacore is particularly useful when the starting antibody already binds with a relatively high affinity, for example a K.sub.D of about 10 nM or lower. Screening using Biacore surface plasmon resonance is described in the Examples, herein.                Binding affinity may be determined using Kinexa Biocensor, scintillation proximity assays, ELISA, ORIGEN immunoassay (IGEN), fluorescence quenching, fluorescence transfer, and/or yeast display. Binding affinity may also be screened using a suitable bioassay.                In some embodiments, every amino acid position in a CDR is replaced (in some embodiments, one at a time) with all 20 natural amino acids using art recognized mutagenesis methods (some of which are described herein). This generates small libraries of clones (in some embodiments, one for every amino acid position that is analyzed), each with a complexity of 20 members (if all 20 amino acids are substituted at every position).                In some embodiments, the library to be screened comprises substitutions in two or more positions, which may be in the same CDR or in two or more CDRs. Thus, the library may comprise substitutions in two or more positions in one CDR. The library may comprise substitution in two or more positions in two or more CDRs. The library may comprise substitution in 3, 4, 5, or more positions, said positions found in two, three, four, five or six CDRs. The substitution may be prepared using low redundancy codons. See, e.g., Table 2 of Balint et al., 1993, Gene 137(1):109-18).                The CDR may be CDRH3 and/or CDRL3. The CDR may be one or more of CDRL1, CDRL2, CDRL3, CDRH1, CDRH2, and/or CDRH3. The CDR may be a Kabat CDR, a Chothia CDR, or an extended CDR.                Candidates with improved binding may be sequenced, thereby identifying a CDR substitution mutant which results in improved affinity (also termed an \"improved\" substitution). Candidates that bind may also be sequenced, thereby identifying a CDR substitution which retains binding.                Multiple rounds of screening may be conducted. For example, candidates (each comprising an amino acid substitution at one or more position of one or more CDR) with improved binding are also useful for the design of a second library containing at least the original and substituted amino acid at each improved CDR position (i.e., amino acid position in the CDR at which a substitution mutant showed improved binding). Preparation, screening, and selection of this library is discussed further below.                Library scanning mutagenesis also provides a means for characterizing a CDR, in so far as the frequency of clones with improved binding, the same binding, decreased binding or no binding also provide information relating to the importance of each amino acid position for the stability of the antibody-antigen complex. For example, if a position of the CDR retains binding when changed to all 20 amino acids, that position is identified as a position that is unlikely to be required for antigen binding. Conversely, if a position of CDR retains binding in only a small percentage of substitutions, that position is identified as a position that is important to CDR function. Thus, the library scanning mutagenesis methods generate information regarding positions in the CDRs that can be changed to many different amino acids (including all 20 amino acids), and positions in the CDRs which cannot be changed or which can only be changed to a few amino acids.                Candidates with improved affinity may be combined in a second library, which includes the improved amino acid, the original amino acid, and may further include additional substitutions at that position, depending on the complexity of the library that is desired, or permitted using the desired screening or selection method. In addition, if desired, and adjacent amino acid position can be randomized to at least two or more amino acids. Randomization of adjacent amino acids may permit additional conformational flexibility in the mutant CDR, which may, in turn, permit or facilitate the introduction of a larger number of improving mutations. The library may also comprise substitution at positions that did not show improved affinity in the first round of screening.                The second library is screened or selected for library members with improved and/or altered binding affinity using any method known in the art, including screening using Biacore surface plasmon resonance analysis, and selection using any method known in the art for selection, including phage display, yeast display, and ribosome display.                The invention also encompasses fusion proteins comprising one or more fragments or regions from the antibodies or polypeptides of this invention. In one embodiment, a fusion polypeptide is provided that comprises at least 10 contiguous amino acids of a variable light chain region shown in SEQ ID NOs: 53, 16, 17, 18, or 19 and/or at least 10 amino acids of a variable heavy chain region shown in SEQ ID NOs: 54, 20, 21, 22, or 23. In other embodiments, a fusion polypeptide is provided that comprises at least about 10, at least about 15, at least about 20, at least about 25, or at least about 30 contiguous amino acids of the variable light chain region and/or at least about 10, at least about 15, at least about 20, at least about 25, or at least about 30 contiguous amino acids of the variable heavy chain region. In another embodiment, the fusion polypeptide comprises a light chain variable region and/or a heavy chain variable region, as shown in any of the sequence pairs selected from among SEQ ID NOs: 53 and 54, 16 and 20, 17 and 21, 18 and 22, and 19 and 23. In another embodiment, the fusion polypeptide comprises one or more CDR(s). In still other embodiments, the fusion polypeptide comprises CDR H3 (VH CDR3) and/or CDR L3 (VL CDR3). For purposes of this invention, a fusion protein contains one or more antibodies and another amino acid sequence to which it is not attached in the native molecule, for example, a heterologous sequence or a homologous sequence from another region. Exemplary heterologous sequences include, but are not limited to a \"tag\" such as a FLAG tag or a 6H is tag. Tags are well known in the art.                A fusion polypeptide can be created by methods known in the art, for example, synthetically or recombinantly. Typically, the fusion proteins of this invention are made by preparing an expressing a polynucleotide encoding them using recombinant methods described herein, although they may also be prepared by other means known in the art, including, for example, chemical synthesis.                This invention also provides compositions comprising antibodies or polypeptides conjugated (for example, linked) to an agent that facilitate coupling to a solid support (such as biotin or avidin). For simplicity, reference will be made generally to antibodies with the understanding that these methods apply to any of the PCSK9 binding and/or antagonist embodiments described herein. Conjugation generally refers to linking these components as described herein. The linking (which is generally fixing these components in proximate association at least for administration) can be achieved in any number of ways. For example, a direct reaction between an agent and an antibody is possible when each possesses a substituent capable of reacting with the other. For example, a nucleophilic group, such as an amino or sulfhydryl group, on one may be capable of reacting with a carbonyl-containing group, such as an anhydride or an acid halide, or with an alkyl group containing a good leaving group (e.g., a halide) on the other.                An antibody or polypeptide of this invention may be linked to a labeling agent such as a fluorescent molecule, a radioactive molecule or any others labels known in the art. Labels are known in the art which generally provide (either directly or indirectly) a signal.                The invention also provides compositions (including pharmaceutical compositions) and kits comprising, as this disclosure makes clear, any or all of the antibodies and/or polypeptides described herein.                The invention also provides isolated polynucleotides encoding the antibodies and peptides of the invention, and vectors and host cells comprising the polynucleotide.                Accordingly, the invention provides polynucleotides (or compositions, including pharmaceutical compositions), comprising polynucleotides encoding any of the following: the antibodies 4A5, 5A10, 6F6, 7D4, L1L3, or any fragment or part thereof having the ability to antagonize PCSK9.                In another aspect, the invention provides polynucleotides encoding any of the antibodies (including antibody fragments) and polypeptides described herein, such as antibodies and polypeptides having impaired effector function. Polynucleotides can be made and expressed by procedures known in the art.                In another aspect, the invention provides compositions (such as pharmaceutical compositions) comprising any of the polynucleotides of the invention. In some embodiments, the composition comprises an expression vector comprising a polynucleotide encoding the antibody as described herein. In other embodiment, the composition comprises an expression vector comprising a polynucleotide encoding any of the antibodies or polypeptides described herein. In still other embodiments, the composition comprises either or both of the polynucleotides shown in SEQ ID NO:25 and SEQ ID NO:26. Expression vectors, and administration of polynucleotide compositions are further described herein.                In another aspect, the invention provides a method of making any of the polynucleotides described herein.                Polynucleotides complementary to any such sequences are also encompassed by the present invention. Polynucleotides may be single-stranded (coding or antisense) or double-stranded, and may be DNA (genomic, cDNA or synthetic) or RNA molecules. RNA molecules include HnRNA molecules, which contain introns and correspond to a DNA molecule in a one-to-one manner, and mRNA molecules, which do not contain introns. Additional coding or non-coding sequences may, but need not, be present within a polynucleotide of the present invention, and a polynucleotide may, but need not, be linked to other molecules and/or support materials.                Polynucleotides may comprise a native sequence (i.e., an endogenous sequence that encodes an antibody or a portion thereof) or may comprise a variant of such a sequence. Polynucleotide variants contain one or more substitutions, additions, deletions and/or insertions such that the immunoreactivity of the encoded polypeptide is not diminished, relative to a native immunoreactive molecule. The effect on the immunoreactivity of the encoded polypeptide may generally be assessed as described herein. Variants preferably exhibit at least about 70% identity, more preferably, at least about 80% identity, yet more preferably, at least about 90% identity, and most preferably, at least about 95% identity to a polynucleotide sequence that encodes a native antibody or a portion thereof.                Two polynucleotide or polypeptide sequences are said to be \"identical\" if the sequence of nucleotides or amino acids in the two sequences is the same when aligned for maximum correspondence as described below. Comparisons between two sequences are typically performed by comparing the sequences over a comparison window to identify and compare local regions of sequence similarity. A \"comparison window\" as used herein, refers to a segment of at least about 20 contiguous positions, usually 30 to about 75, or 40 to about 50, in which a sequence may be compared to a reference sequence of the same number of contiguous positions after the two sequences are optimally aligned.                Optimal alignment of sequences for comparison may be conducted using the Megalign program in the Lasergene suite of bioinformatics software (DNASTAR, Inc., Madison, Wis.), using default parameters. This program embodies several alignment schemes described in the following references: Dayhoff, M. O., 1978, A model of evolutionary change in proteins--Matrices for detecting distant relationships. In Dayhoff, M. O. (ed.) Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure (National Biomedical Research Foundation, Washington D.C.), Vol. 5, Suppl. 3, pp. 345-358; Hein J., 1990, Unified Approach to Alignment and Phylogenes pp. 626-645 Methods in Enzymology vol. 183, (Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, Calif.); Higgins, D. G. and Sharp, P. M., 1989, CABIOS 5:151-153; Myers, E. W. and Muller W., 1988, CABIOS 4:11-17; Robinson, E. D., 1971, Comb. Theor. 11:105; Santou, N., Nes, M., 1987, Mol. Biol. Evol. 4:406-425; Sneath, P. H. A. and Sokal, R. R., 1973, Numerical Taxonomy the Principles and Practice of Numerical Taxonomy (Freeman Press, San Francisco, Calif.); Wilbur, W. J. and Lipman, D. J., 1983, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 80:726-730.                Preferably, the \"percentage of sequence identity\" is determined by comparing two optimally aligned sequences over a window of comparison of at least 20 positions, wherein the portion of the polynucleotide or polypeptide sequence in the comparison window may comprise additions or deletions (i.e., gaps) of 20 percent or less, usually 5 to 15 percent, or 10 to 12 percent, as compared to the reference sequences (which does not comprise additions or deletions) for optimal alignment of the two sequences. The percentage is calculated by determining the number of positions at which the identical nucleic acid bases or amino acid residue occurs in both sequences to yield the number of matched positions, dividing the number of matched positions by the total number of positions in the reference sequence (i.e. the window size) and multiplying the results by 100 to yield the percentage of sequence identity.                Variants may also, or alternatively, be substantially homologous to a native gene, or a portion or complement thereof. Such polynucleotide variants are capable of hybridizing under moderately stringent conditions to a naturally occurring DNA sequence encoding a native antibody (or a complementary sequence).                Suitable \"moderately stringent conditions\" include prewashing in a solution of 5.times.SSC, 0.5% SDS, 1.0 mM EDTA (pH 8.0); hybridizing at 50.degree. C.-65.degree. C., 5.times.SSC, overnight; followed by washing twice at 65.degree. C. for 20 minutes with each of 2.times., 0.5.times. and 0.2.times.SSC containing 0.1% SDS.                As used herein, \"highly stringent conditions\" or \"high stringency conditions\" are those that: (1) employ low ionic strength and high temperature for washing, for example 0.015 M sodium chloride/0.0015 M sodium citrate/0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate at 50.degree. C.; (2) employ during hybridization a denaturing agent, such as formamide, for example, 50% (v/v) formamide with 0.1% bovine serum albumin/0.1.degree. k Ficoll/0.1% polyvinylpyrrolidone/50 mM sodium phosphate buffer at pH 6.5 with 750 mM sodium chloride, 75 mM sodium citrate at 42.degree. C.; or (3) employ 50% formamide, 5.times.SSC (0.75 M NaCl, 0.075 M sodium citrate), 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.8), 0.1% sodium pyrophosphate, 5.times.Denhardt's solution, sonicated salmon sperm DNA (50 .mu.g/ml), 0.1% SDS, and 10% dextran sulfate at 42.degree. C., with washes at 42.degree. C. in 0.2.times.SSC (sodium chloride/sodium citrate) and 50% formamide at 55.degree. C., followed by a high-stringency wash consisting of 0.1.times.SSC containing EDTA at 55.degree. C. The skilled artisan will recognize how to adjust the temperature, ionic strength, etc. as necessary to accommodate factors such as probe length and the like.                It will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that, as a result of the degeneracy of the genetic code, there are many nucleotide sequences that encode a polypeptide as described herein. Some of these polynucleotides bear minimal homology to the nucleotide sequence of any native gene. Nonetheless, polynucleotides that vary due to differences in codon usage are specifically contemplated by the present invention. Further, alleles of the genes comprising the polynucleotide sequences provided herein are within the scope of the present invention. Alleles are endogenous genes that are altered as a result of one or more mutations, such as deletions, additions and/or substitutions of nucleotides. The resulting mRNA and protein may, but need not, have an altered structure or function. Alleles may be identified using standard techniques (such as hybridization, amplification and/or database sequence comparison).                The polynucleotides of this invention can be obtained using chemical synthesis, recombinant methods, or PCR. Methods of chemical polynucleotide synthesis are well known in the art and need not be described in detail herein. One of skill in the art can use the sequences provided herein and a commercial DNA synthesizer to produce a desired DNA sequence.                For preparing polynucleotides using recombinant methods, a polynucleotide comprising a desired sequence can be inserted into a suitable vector, and the vector in turn can be introduced into a suitable host cell for replication and amplification, as further discussed herein. Polynucleotides may be inserted into host cells by any means known in the art. Cells are transformed by introducing an exogenous polynucleotide by direct uptake, endocytosis, transfection, F-mating or electroporation. Once introduced, the exogenous polynucleotide can be maintained within the cell as a non-integrated vector (such as a plasmid) or integrated into the host cell genome. The polynucleotide so amplified can be isolated from the host cell by methods well known within the art. See, e.g., Sambrook et al., 1989, supra.                Alternatively, PCR allows reproduction of DNA sequences. PCR technology is well known in the art and is described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,683,195, 4,800,159, 4,754,065 and 4,683,202, as well as PCR: The Polymerase Chain Reaction, Mullis et al., 1994, eds. (Birkauswer Press, Boston, Mass.).                RNA can be obtained by using the isolated DNA in an appropriate vector and inserting it into a suitable host cell. When the cell replicates and the DNA is transcribed into RNA, the RNA can then be isolated using methods well known to those of skill in the art, as set forth in Sambrook et al., 1989, supra, for example.                Suitable cloning vectors may be constructed according to standard techniques, or may be selected from a large number of cloning vectors available in the art. While the cloning vector selected may vary according to the host cell intended to be used, useful cloning vectors will generally have the ability to self-replicate, may possess a single target for a particular restriction endonuclease, and/or may carry genes for a marker that can be used in selecting clones containing the vector. Suitable examples include plasmids and bacterial viruses, e.g., pUC18, pUC19, Bluescript (e.g., pBS SK+) and its derivatives, mp 18, mp 19, pBR322, pMB9, ColE1, pCR1, RP4, phage DNAs, and shuttle vectors such as pSA3 and pAT28. These and many other cloning vectors are available from commercial vendors such as BioRad, Strategene, and Invitrogen.                Expression vectors generally are replicable polynucleotide constructs that contain a polynucleotide according to the invention. It is implied that an expression vector must be replicable in the host cells either as episomes or as an integral part of the chromosomal DNA. Suitable expression vectors include but are not limited to plasmids, viral vectors, including adenoviruses, adeno-associated viruses, retroviruses, cosmids, and expression vector(s) disclosed in PCT Publ. No. WO 87/04462. Vector components may generally include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following: a signal sequence; an origin of replication; one or more marker genes; suitable transcriptional controlling elements (such as promoters, enhancers and terminator). For expression (i.e., translation), one or more translational controlling elements are also usually required, such as ribosome binding sites, translation initiation sites, and stop codons.                The vectors containing the polynucleotides of interest can be introduced into the host cell by any of a number of appropriate means, including electroporation, transfection employing calcium chloride, rubidium chloride, calcium phosphate, DEAE-dextran, or other substances; microprojectile bombardment; lipofection; and infection (e.g., where the vector is an infectious agent such as vaccinia virus). The choice of introducing vectors or polynucleotides will often depend on features of the host cell.                The invention also provides host cells comprising any of the polynucleotides described herein. Any host cells capable of over-expressing heterologous DNAs can be used for the purpose of isolating the genes encoding the antibody, polypeptide or protein of interest. Non-limiting examples of mammalian host cells include but are not limited to COS, HeLa, NSO, and CHO cells. See also PCT Publ. No. WO 87/04462. Suitable non-mammalian host cells include prokaryotes (such as E. coli or B. subtillis) and yeast (such as S. cerevisae, S. pombe; or K. lactis). Preferably, the host cells express the cDNAs at a level of about 5 fold higher, more preferably, 10 fold higher, even more preferably, 20 fold higher than that of the corresponding endogenous antibody or protein of interest, if present, in the host cells. Screening the host cells for a specific binding to PCSK9 or a PCSK9 domain is effected by an immunoassay or FACS. A cell overexpressing the antibody or protein of interest can be identified.                C. Compositions                The compositions used in the methods of the invention comprise an effective amount of a PCSK9 antagonist antibody, a PCSK9 antagonist antibody derived polypeptide, or other PCSK9 antagonists described herein. Examples of such compositions, as well as how to formulate them, are also described in an earlier section and below. In one embodiment, the composition further comprises a PCSK9 antagonist. In another embodiment, the composition comprises one or more PCSK9 antagonist antibodies. In other embodiments, the PCSK9 antagonist antibody recognizes human PCSK9. In still other embodiments, the PCSK9 antagonist antibody is humanized. In yet other embodiments, the PCSK9 antagonist antibody comprises a constant region that does not trigger an unwanted or undesirable immune response, such as antibody-mediated lysis or ADCC. In other embodiments, the PCSK9 antagonist antibody comprises one or more CDR(s) of the antibody (such as one, two, three, four, five, or, in some embodiments, all six CDRs). In some embodiments, the PCSK9 antagonist antibody is human.                It is understood that the compositions can comprise more than one PCSK9 antagonist antibody (e.g., a mixture of PCSK9 antagonist antibodies that recognize different epitopes of PCSK9). Other exemplary compositions comprise more than one PCSK9 antagonist antibodies that recognize the same epitope(s), or different species of PCSK9 antagonist antibodies that bind to different epitopes of PCSK9.                The composition used in the present invention can further comprise pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients, or stabilizers (Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy 20th Ed., 2000, Lippincott Williams and Wilkins, Ed. K. E. Hoover), in the form of lyophilized formulations or aqueous solutions. Acceptable carriers, excipients, or stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations, and may comprise buffers such as phosphate, citrate, and other organic acids; antioxidants including ascorbic acid and methionine; preservatives (such as octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride; hexamethonium chloride; benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride; phenol, butyl or benzyl alcohol; alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl paraben; catechol; resorcinol; cyclohexanol; 3-pentanol; and m-cresol); low molecular weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptides; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, histidine, arginine, or lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates including glucose, mannose, or dextrans; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugars such as sucrose, mannitol, trehalose or sorbitol; salt-forming counter-ions such as sodium; metal complexes (e.g., Zn-protein complexes); and/or non-ionic surfactants such as TWEEN.TM., PLURONICS.TM. or polyethylene glycol (PEG). Pharmaceutically acceptable excipients are further described herein.                In one embodiment, the antibody is administered in a formulation as a sterile aqueous solution having a pH that ranges from about 5.0 to about 6.5 and comprising from about 1 mg/ml to about 200 mg/ml of antibody, from about 1 millimolar to about 100 millimolar of histidine buffer, from about 0.01 mg/ml to about 10 mg/ml of polysorbate 80, from about 100 millimolar to about 400 millimolar of trehalose, and from about 0.01 millimolar to about 1.0 millimolar of disodium EDTA dihydrate.                The PCSK9 antagonist antibody and compositions thereof can also be used in conjunction with other agents that serve to enhance and/or complement the effectiveness of the agents.                D. Kits                The invention also provides kits for use in the instant methods. Kits of the invention include one or more containers comprising a PCSK9 antagonist antibody (such as a humanized antibody) or peptide described herein and instructions for use in accordance with any of the methods of the invention described herein. Generally, these instructions comprise a description of administration of the PCSK9 antagonist antibody, peptide, or aptamer for the above described therapeutic treatments.                In some embodiments, the antibody is a humanized antibody. In some embodiments, the antibody is human. In other embodiments, the antibody is a monoclonal antibody. The instructions relating to the use of a PCSK9 antagonist antibody generally include information as to dosage, dosing schedule, and route of administration for the intended treatment. The containers may be unit doses, bulk packages (e.g., multi-dose packages) or sub-unit doses. Instructions supplied in the kits of the invention are typically written instructions on a label or package insert (e.g., a paper sheet included in the kit), but machine-readable instructions (e.g., instructions carried on a magnetic or optical storage disk) are also acceptable.                The kits of this invention are in suitable packaging. Suitable packaging includes, but is not limited to, vials, bottles, jars, flexible packaging (e.g., sealed Mylar or plastic bags), and the like. Also contemplated are packages for use in combination with a specific device, such as an inhaler, nasal administration device (e.g., an atomizer) or an infusion device such as a minipump. A kit may have a sterile access port (for example the container may be an intravenous solution bag or a vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle). The container may also have a sterile access port (for example the container may be an intravenous solution bag or a vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle). At least one active agent in the composition is a PCSK9 antagonist antibody. The container (e.g., pre-filled syringe or autoinjector) may further comprise a second pharmaceutically active agent.                Kits may optionally provide additional components such as buffers and interpretive information. Normally, the kit comprises a container and a label or package insert(s) on or associated with the container.                Mutations and Modifications                To express the PCSK9 antibodies of the present invention, DNA fragments encoding V.sub.H and V.sub.L regions can first be obtained using any of the methods described above. Various modifications, e.g., mutations, deletions, and/or additions can also be introduced into the DNA sequences using standard methods known to those of skill in the art. For example, mutagenesis can be carried out using standard methods, such as PCR-mediated mutagenesis, in which the mutated nucleotides are incorporated into the PCR primers such that the PCR product contains the desired mutations or site-directed mutagenesis.                One type of substitution, for example, that may be made is to change one or more cysteines in the antibody, which may be chemically reactive, to another residue, such as, without limitation, alanine or serine. For example, there can be a substitution of a non-canonical cysteine. The substitution can be made in a CDR or framework region of a variable domain or in the constant domain of an antibody. In some embodiments, the cysteine is canonical.                The antibodies may also be modified, e.g., in the variable domains of the heavy and/or light chains, e.g., to alter a binding property of the antibody. For example, a mutation may be made in one or more of the CDR regions to increase or decrease the K.sub.D of the antibody for PCSK9, to increase or decrease k.sub.off, or to alter the binding specificity of the antibody. Techniques in site-directed mutagenesis are well-known in the art. See, e.g., Sambrook et al. and Ausubel et al., supra.                A modification or mutation may also be made in a framework region or constant domain to increase the half-life of a PCSK9 antibody. See, e.g., PCT Publ. No. WO 00/09560. A mutation in a framework region or constant domain can also be made to alter the immunogenicity of the antibody, to provide a site for covalent or non-covalent binding to another molecule, or to alter such properties as complement fixation, FcR binding and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. According to the invention, a single antibody may have mutations in any one or more of the CDRs or framework regions of the variable domain or in the constant domain.                In a process known as \"germlining\", certain amino acids in the V.sub.H and V.sub.L sequences can be mutated to match those found naturally in germline V.sub.H and V.sub.L sequences. In particular, the amino acid sequences of the framework regions in the V.sub.H and V.sub.L sequences can be mutated to match the germline sequences to reduce the risk of immunogenicity when the antibody is administered. Germline DNA sequences for human V.sub.H and V.sub.L genes are known in the art (see e.g., the \"Vbase\" human germline sequence database; see also Kabat, E. A., et al. (1991) Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, Fifth Edition, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, NIH Publ. No. 91-3242; Tomlinson et al., 1992, J. Mol. Biol. 227:776-798; and Cox et al., 1994, Eur. J. Immunol. 24:827-836.                Another type of amino acid substitution that may be made is to remove potential proteolytic sites in the antibody. Such sites may occur in a CDR or framework region of a variable domain or in the constant domain of an antibody. Substitution of cysteine residues and removal of proteolytic sites may decrease the risk of heterogeneity in the antibody product and thus increase its homogeneity. Another type of amino acid substitution eliminates asparagine-glycine pairs, which form potential deamidation sites, by altering one or both of the residues. In another example, the C-terminal lysine of the heavy chain of a PCSK9 antibody of the invention can be cleaved. In various embodiments of the invention, the heavy and light chains of the PCSK9 antibodies may optionally include a signal sequence.                Once DNA fragments encoding the V.sub.H and V.sub.L segments of the present invention are obtained, these DNA fragments can be further manipulated by standard recombinant DNA techniques, for example to convert the variable region genes to full-length antibody chain genes, to Fab fragment genes, or to a scFv gene. In these manipulations, a V.sub.L- or V.sub.H-encoding DNA fragment is operatively linked to another DNA fragment encoding another protein, such as an antibody constant region or a flexible linker. The term \"operatively linked\", as used in this context, is intended to mean that the two DNA fragments are joined such that the amino acid sequences encoded by the two DNA fragments remain in-frame.                The isolated DNA encoding the V.sub.H region can be converted to a full-length heavy chain gene by operatively linking the V.sub.H-encoding DNA to another DNA molecule encoding heavy chain constant regions (CH1, CH2 and CH3). The sequences of human heavy chain constant region genes are known in the art (see e.g., Kabat, E. A., et al., 1991, Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, Fifth Edition, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, NIH Publ. No. 91-3242) and DNA fragments encompassing these regions can be obtained by standard PCR amplification. The heavy chain constant region can be an IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA, IgE, IgM or IgD constant region, but most preferably is an IgG1 or IgG2 constant region. The IgG constant region sequence can be any of the various alleles or allotypes known to occur among different individuals, such as Gm(1), Gm(2), Gm(3), and Gm(17). These allotypes represent naturally occurring amino acid substitution in the IgG1 constant regions. For a Fab fragment heavy chain gene, the VH-encoding DNA can be operatively linked to another DNA molecule encoding only the heavy chain CH1 constant region. The CH1 heavy chain constant region may be derived from any of the heavy chain genes.                The isolated DNA encoding the V.sub.L region can be converted to a full-length light chain gene (as well as a Fab light chain gene) by operatively linking the V.sub.L-encoding DNA to another DNA molecule encoding the light chain constant region, C.sub.L. The sequences of human light chain constant region genes are known in the art (see e.g., Kabat, E. A., et al., 1991, Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, Fifth Edition, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, NIH Publ. No. 91-3242) and DNA fragments encompassing these regions can be obtained by standard PCR amplification. The light chain constant region can be a kappa or lambda constant region. The kappa constant region may be any of the various alleles known to occur among different individuals, such as Inv(1), Inv(2), and Inv(3). The lambda constant region may be derived from any of the three lambda genes.                To create a scFv gene, the V.sub.H- and V.sub.L-encoding DNA fragments are operatively linked to another fragment encoding a flexible linker, e.g., encoding the amino acid sequence (Gly4-Ser).sub.3, such that the V.sub.H and V.sub.L sequences can be expressed as a contiguous single-chain protein, with the V.sub.L and V.sub.H regions joined by the flexible linker (See e.g., Bird et al., 1988, Science 242:423-426; Huston et al., 1988, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:5879-5883; McCafferty et al., 1990, Nature 348:552-554. The single chain antibody may be monovalent, if only a single V.sub.H and V.sub.L are used, bivalent, if two V.sub.H and V.sub.L are used, or polyvalent, if more than two V.sub.H and V.sub.L are used. Bispecific or polyvalent antibodies may be generated that bind specifically to PCSK9 and to another molecule.                In another embodiment, a fusion antibody or immunoadhesin may be made that comprises all or a portion of a PCSK9 antibody of the invention linked to another polypeptide. In another embodiment, only the variable domains of the PCSK9 antibody are linked to the polypeptide. In another embodiment, the V.sub.H domain of a PCSK9 antibody is linked to a first polypeptide, while the V.sub.L domain of a PCSK9 antibody is linked to a second polypeptide that associates with the first polypeptide in a manner such that the V.sub.H and V.sub.L domains can interact with one another to form an antigen binding site. In another preferred embodiment, the VH domain is separated from the V.sub.L domain by a linker such that the VH and VL domains can interact with one another. The V.sub.H-linker-V.sub.L antibody is then linked to the polypeptide of interest. In addition, fusion antibodies can be created in which two (or more) single-chain antibodies are linked to one another. This is useful if one wants to create a divalent or polyvalent antibody on a single polypeptide chain, or if one wants to create a bispecific antibody.                In other embodiments, other modified antibodies may be prepared using PCSK9 antibody encoding nucleic acid molecules. For instance, \"Kappa bodies\" (Ill et al., 1997, Protein Eng. 10:949-57), \"Minibodies\" (Martin et al., 1994, EMBO J. 13:5303-9), \"Diabodies\" (Holliger et al., 1993, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:6444-6448), or \"Janusins\" (Traunecker et al., 1991, EMBO J. 10:3655-3659 and Traunecker et al., 1992, Int. J. Cancer (Suppl.) 7:51-52) may be prepared using standard molecular biological techniques following the teachings of the specification.                Bispecific antibodies or antigen-binding fragments can be produced by a variety of methods including fusion of hybridomas or linking of Fab' fragments. See, e.g., Songsivilai & Lachmann, 1990, Clin. Exp. Immunol. 79:315-321, Kostelny et al., 1992, J. Immunol. 148:1547-1553. In addition, bispecific antibodies may be formed as \"diabodies\" or \"Janusins.\" In some embodiments, the bispecific antibody binds to two different epitopes of PCSK9. In some embodiments, the modified antibodies described above are prepared using one or more of the variable domains or CDR regions from a human PCSK9 antibody provided herein.                Generation of Antigen-Specific Antibodies                More than 500 polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies raised against recombinant full-length human PCSK9, recombinant full length mouse PCSK9, and various synthetic peptides were evaluated for their ability to down regulate total LDLR protein in cultured Huh7 human liver cells. Among these antibodies were a set of antibodies raised to and reactive with a set of 12-20 amino acid residue polypeptides that, based on the structure of PCSK9, were predicted to cover majority of the protein surface. At the highest concentration, the best antibodies exhibited only about 60% blocking activity.                Thus, an alternative and heretofore unexplored approach was employed, namely, the generation of monoclonal antibodies by immunizing PCSK9 null mice with recombinant full-length PCSK9 protein. This manner of antibody preparation yielded antagonist antibodies that show complete blocking of PCSK9 binding to LDLR, complete blocking of PCSK9-mediated lowering of LDLR levels in Huh7 cells, and lowering of LDLc in vivo including in mice to levels comparable to that seen in PCSK9-/- mice, as shown in Example 7.                Representative antibodies (hybridomas) of the present invention were deposited in the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) on Feb. 28, 2008, and were assigned the accession numbers in Table 3. Hybridomas were deposited for antibodies 4A5, 5A10, 6F6 and 7D4.                TABLE-US-00003 TABLE 3 Antibody Reference ATCC Accession No. 4A5 PTA-8985 5A10 PTA-8986 6F6 PTA-8984 7D4 PTA-8983                EXAMPLES                Example 1                Generating and Screening PCSK9 Antagonist Antibodies                General Procedures for Immunization of Animals for Generating Monoclonal Antibodies:                Balb/c or 129/bl6 pcsk9-/- mice were injected 5 times on a 13 day schedule with 100 .mu.g antigen. PCSK9-/- (that is, null or knock-out mice) can be obtained from, or as described by, Rashid et al., 2005, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 102: 5374. See also U.S. Pat. No. 7,300,754. For the first 4 injections, antigen was prepared by mixing the recombinant proteins with adjuvant. Immunogen was given via injection to the scruff of the neck, the foot pads and intraperitoneally, approximately every 3 days over the course of 11 days, with the last boost administered i.v., without adjuvant. On Day 13, the mice were euthanized and their spleens were removed. Lymphocytes were immortalized by fusion with an established cell line to make hybridoma clones using standard hybridoma technology, distributed into 96 well plates. Clones were allowed to grow, then selected by ELISA screening using the immunizing antigen, as below.                ELISA Screening of Antibodies:                Supernatant media from growing hybridoma clones were screened separately for their ability to bind the recombinant human PCSK9 or recombinant mouse PCSK9. The assays were performed with 96-well plates coated overnight with 100 .mu.l of a 1 .mu.g/ml solution of one of the antigens. Excess reagents were washed from the wells between each step with PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20. Plates were then blocked with PBS containing 0.5% BSA. Supernatant was added to the plates and incubated at room temperature for 2 hours. Horse radish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated goat-anti mouse Fc was added to bind to the mouse antibodies bound to the antigen. Tetramethyl benzidine was then added as substrate for HRP to detect the amount of mouse antibody present in the supernatant. The reaction was stopped and the relative amount of antibody was quantified by reading the absorbance at 450 nm. Hybridoma clones that secreted antibodies that are capable of binding to either mouse or human PCSK9 were selected for further analysis.                PCSK9-Mediated LDLR Down-Regulation in Huh7 Cells:                Hybridoma clones secreting human or mouse PCSK9 binding antibodies were expanded and supernatants were harvested. Total IgGs were purified from approximately 10 ml of the supernatant using protein A beads, dialyzed into PBS buffer, and the final volume reduced to yield solutions with 0.7-1 mg/ml of antibodies. Purified antibodies were then used to test their ability to inhibit the ability of PCSK9 to mediate LDLR down-regulation in Huh7 cells. Huh7 cells were plated and allowed to grow to 80% confluency in RPMI media containing 10% FBS, 4 mM glutamine, and penicillin and streptavidin in 96 well plates. The medium was changed to one containing 10% de-lipidated FBS for 8-16 hrs to induce LDLR expression. Cells were then incubated for 8-16 hours with 40 .mu.l/well of 293 expression media supplemented with 6 .mu.g/ml of human (preferably) or mouse PCSK9, with or without 70-100 .mu.g/ml of test antibodies. The PCSK9 and antibody containing media were removed at the end of incubation, and cells were lysed with 17 .mu.l lysis buffer by shaking at 4 C for an hour. The lysis buffer consisted of 50 mM glycerol phosphate, 10 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 20 mM NaCl, and a cocktail of protease inhibitors (Roche). Cell lysates were collected and analyzed for LDLR protein levels via staining of Western blots following SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Hybridoma clones producing antibodies that can partially or fully rescue LDLR level were selected for further analysis. By \"LDLR down regulation assay\" is meant the above assay using Huh7 cells.                FIG. 1 illustrates the effect of anti-PCSK9 antagonistic monoclonal antibodies 7D4.4, 4A5.G3, 6F6.G10.3 and 5A10.B8 on the ability of human and mouse PCSK9 to down regulate LDLR in cultured Huh7 cells. 100 nM of mouse or human recombinant PCSK9, and a serial dilution of 25-800 nM of antibodies were used. A) mouse PCSK9. B) human PCSK9. The figures are Western blots showing that the antibodies are in general more effective in blocking the function of human PCSk9 than mouse PCSK9. The several antibodies have generally similar affinities for human PCSK9 but vary in their affinity for murine PCSK9.                Example 2                Determining Antibody Binding Affinity                The affinities of PCSK9 antibodies to PCSK9 were measured on a surface plasmon resonance Biacore 3000 biosensor equipped with a research-grade sensor chip using HBS-EP running buffer (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden--now GE Healthcare). Rabbit polyclonal anti-Ms IgGs were amine-coupled at saturating levels onto the chip using a standard N-hydroxysuccinimide/ethyldimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide (NHS/EDC) chemistry. The buffer was switched to HBS-EP+1 mg/mL BSA+1 mg/mL CM-dextran. Full-length PCSK9 IgGs were diluted to about 15 .mu.g/mL and captured for 1 min at 5 .mu.L/min to give levels of about 500RU per flow cell, leaving one blank to serve as a reference channel. 3.73-302 nM hPCSK9 or 2.54-206 nM mPCSK9 were injected as a 5-membered 3-fold series for 1 min at 100 .mu.L/min.                Dissociation was monitored for 5 min. The chip was regenerated after the last injection of each titration with two 30 sec pulses of 100 mM phosphoric acid. Buffer cycles provided blanks for double-referencing the data, which were then fit globally to a simple binding model using Biaevaluation software v.4.1. Affinities were deduced from the quotient of the kinetic rate constants (K.sub.D=k.sub.off/k.sub.on). The results of Example 2 are shown in Table 4. These data show that the antibodies have excellent affinity for murine PCSK9 or human PCSK9, as indicated.

Recombinant mouse or human PCSK9 protein was biotinylated using the Pierce reagents following the manufacture's instructions. ELISA plates (Corning Mixisorb) were coated with a solution of 1 .mu.g/ml recombinant LDLR extracellular domain (R&D Systems) in each well at 4 C overnight, blocked with 2% BSA+PBS for 2 hrs at room temperature, and then washed 5 times with washing buffer (1.times.PBS+0.05% Tween-20). Wells were incubated with 50 .mu.l of indicated concentrations of biotinylated PCSK9 protein for 1 hr RT. LDLR-PCSK9 binding can be stabilized by adding 50 .mu.l of 4% FDH+4% sucrose+PBS solution and incubate for 5 min. Wells were washed 5 times with washing buffer, incubated with 1:2000 dilution of HRP conjugated Strepavidin (Invitrogen) for 1 hr at RT, washed 5 times with washing buffer. TMB substrate was added to the wells, the solution was incubated 20 to 30 min at RT, and the reaction was terminated using 1 M phosphoric acid. Signals were read at 450 nm.                FIG. 2 illustrates the dose-response of anti-PCSK9 antagonist monoclonal antibodies 6F6.G10.3, 7D4.4, 4A5.G3, 5A10.B8, negative control antibody 42H7, and PBS on blocking the binding of recombinant biotinylated human PCSK9 and mouse PCSK9 to immobilized recombinant LDLR extracellular domain in vitro. Part A) shows human PCSK9 binding to human LDLR extracellular domain and that 7D4, 4A5, 5A10, and 6F6 are effective in blocking binding, whereas 42H7 and PBS are not. Part B) shows mouse PCSK9 binding to human LDLR extracellular domain.                The interaction can also be evaluated in free solution at neutral pH. FIG. 3 illustrates the dose-response of anti-PCSK9 monoclonal antagonist antibodies 6F6.G10.3, 7D4.4, 4A5.G3 and 5A10.B8 on blocking binding of recombinant biotinylated human PCSK9 (30 nM) to Europium labeled recombinant LDLR extracellular domain (10 nM) in solution at neutral pH in vitro. This assay measures binding in free solution at neutral pH.                Example 4                Epitope Mapping/Binding of Antibodies using the Crystal Structure of the L1L3:PCSK9 Complex, Biacore, and Mutagenesis                a. Crystal structure of the L1L3:PCSK9 complex. The residues were identified by calculating the difference in accessible surface area between the L1L3:PCSK9 crystal structure and PCSK9 structure alone. PCSK9 residues that show buried surface area upon complex formation with L1L3 antibody were included as a part of the epitope. The solvent accessible surface of a protein was defined as the locus of the centre of a probe sphere (representing a solvent molecule of 1.4 .ANG. radius) as it rolls over the Van der Waals surface of the protein. The solvent accessible surface area was calculated by generating surface points on an extended sphere about each atom (at a distance from the atom centre equal to the sum of the atom and probe radii), and eliminating those that lie within equivalent spheres associated with neighboring atoms as implemented in program AREAIMOL (Briggs, P. J., 2000, CCP4 Newsletter No. 38, CCLRC, Daresbury).                The result of the crystal structure analysis are shown in FIG. 23. FIG. 23A shows the crystal structure of the PCSK9 (light gray surface representation) bound to the L1L3 antibody (black cartoon representation). The epitope for L1L3 binding to PCSK9 involves residues 153-155, 194, 197, 237-239, 367, 369, 374-379 and 381 of the PCSK9 amino acid sequence (SEQ ID NO:53). By comparison, the epitope for the LDLR EGF domain binding to PCSK9 involves residues 153-155, 194, 238, 367, 369, 372, 374-375, and 377-381 (Kwon et al., 2008, PNAS 105: 1820-1825).                b. Group antibodies and epitopes based on competition in PCSK9 binding. Full-length IgGs were amine-coupled to a CM5 sensor chip (three per chip at about 7000RU final), using a standard EDC/NHS-mediated amine-coupling chemistry. One flow cell was left unmodified to provide a reference channel. Human-PCSK9 (100 nM) was premixed with an array of IgGs (final 500 nM) and these complexes were injected over the chip using 1 min injections at 10 .mu.L/min. Antibodies that bind to competing epitopes will block the binding of PCSK9 to the antibody immobilized on the chip. Alternatively, a classical sandwich approach was used by first injecting human-PCSK9 at 50 nM for 1 min at 10 .mu.L/min (to tether it via the IgG on the chip) and then binding an array of IgGs (final 500 nM each) for 2 mins each. The immobilized IgGs were regenerated with a mild acid (Pierce gentle elution buffer+1 M NaCl). Antibodies directed to known different epitopes were used as controls for positive sandwich formation in this assay.                c. Structure-guided mutagenesis to map antibody binding epitopes. Based on the crystal structure of PCSK9 and the likely involvement of D374 in LDLR binding (Cunningham et al., 2007, Nat Struct Mol Biol, 14(5): 413-419), nineteen PCSK9 surface-residue mutants (F379A, 1369A, R194A, D374Y, D238R, T377R, K222A, R199A, F216A, R218A, R237A, D192R, D367R, R165A, R167A, A443T, A53V, 1474V, H449A) near or far from the position of D374 were chosen for mutation to map the antibody binding epitopes.                d. Mutant and antibody production. The 19 single point mutants were generated from the previously described wild-type DNA construct (Cunningham et al., 2007, supra) using standard DNA techniques. The mutant proteins were expressed using transient transfection in HEK293T cells and secreted into the cell media. The mutant proteins were purified with the high-throughput AKTA Xpress system (GE Healthcare) by Ni.sup.2+ and size-exclusion chromatography steps, using conditions similar to those described earlier. Protein concentrations were determined using the LabChip instrument (Bio-Rad). The PCSK9-blocking murine antibodies 4A5, 7D4, 5A10 and 6F6 were expressed with transient transfection in HEK293F cells and purified with a protein G column eluted with 0.1 M Glycine buffer at pH 2.8 and neutralized into 1.0 M Tris at pH 9.0.                e. The regions of PCSK9 that are contacted by monoclonal antibodies 5A10 and 7D4 (preparation described later herein) were determined by protein tomography (Sidec A B, Stockholm, Sweden). The loops at positions 186-200, 371-379, 176-181, 278-283, 449-453, 402-406, and 236-245 of PCSK9 were proximal to amino acid residues of the antibody. The sequences corresponding to the loops are shown in Table 5, and in a preferred embodiment, the antagonists of the invention bind to one or more of these sequences in PSCK9.                TABLE-US-00005 TABLE 5 PCSK9 Loops Sequence SEQ ID NO. 186-200 DTSIQSDHREIEGRV 1 236-245 GRDAGVAKGA 2 371-379 ASSDCSTCF 3 176-181 GGSLVE 4 278-283 QPVGPL 5 449-453 HGAGW 6 402-406 AEPEL 7                f. Biacore binding of the mutants to immobilized LDLR. Recombinant LDLR extracellular domain protein was immobilized onto a Biacore SA chip. Each mutant protein was injected to the Biacore-3000 M) in duplicates at 25 mM to 0.012 mM at five concentrations (from 1.degree. C., with a running buffer of 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 2 mM CaCl.sub.2, 200 mM NaCl, 0.02% P20 and 1 mg/ml BSA. All the results fit nicely to a 1:1 binding kinetics model. As expected, mutation at residues in direct contact with the EGF-A domain (F379A, R194A, 1369A, T377R, D238R) significantly weakens (by 10-100 fold) LDLR binding. Moreover, three mutants not in contact with EGF-A (R199A, R218A, K222A) showed weaker binding (5-15 fold). This new finding suggests that they are involved in binding other domains of LDLR. Overall, these experiments validate the integrity and activity of the mutants for subsequent epitope mapping experiments.                g. Binding of the mutants to immobilized 4A5, 7D4, 5A10 and 6F6 antibodies. Biotinylated anti-PCSK9 antibodies were immobilized on SA chips using standard methods. Mutant binding experiments were performed using Biacore 3000 at 25.degree. C. with a running buffer of 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl and 0.02% P20. Mutants were tested at 333 nM or 111 nM concentrations in duplicates, with the ones giving weakened binding compared to the wild-type as the residues involved in mAb binding (listed below).                TABLE-US-00006 mAb Binding Residues in Descending Order of Mutant Effects 4A5 R237, F379, 369, R194, R199 & D238 5A10 R194, R237, I369, D238, R199 6F6 R237, R194, F379, D238, I369, T377, R199 7D4 R237, R194, F379, I369, R199                Example 5                Cloning and Sequencing of Antibodies                One million hybridoma cells were homogenized using the QIAshredder spin columns and total RNA was extracted according to RNAeasy Micro kit from QIAGEN. cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript III RT kit from Invitrogen. Variable regions from the PCSK9 antibodies were cloned using the mouse IgG-Primer Sets from Novagen, which consist of degenerate primers for cloning mouse IgG heavy chain genes and the mouse kappa or lambda light chains. PCR cycling conditions were the followings: 1 cycle at 92 C for 2 min; two cycles at 94 C for 30 sec, 44 C for 30 sec and 72 C for 2 min; two cycles at 94 C for 30 sec, 46 C for 30 sec and 72 C for 2 min; two cycles at 94 C for 30 sec, 48 C for 30 sec and 72 C for 2 min; two cycles at 94 C for 30 sec, 50 C for 30 sec and 72 C for 2 min; two cycles at 94 C for 30 sec, 52 C for 30 sec and 72 C for 2 min; followed by 35 cycles at 94 C for 30 sec, 54 C for 30 sec and 72 C for 45 sec. The resulting PCR products were cloned into Topo-TA cloning vector from Invitrogen and sequenced. The cloned antibody sequences were confirmed by N-terminal sequencing of the first 10 amino acids of the original antibodies produced from ascites.                Example 6                Generation of Antigens for Immunization                Recombinant human PCSK9 protein was produced as reported Cunningham et al., 2007, Nat Struct Mol Biol, 14(5):413-9. To produce recombinant mouse PCSK9 protein, the cDNA of mouse PCSK9 was cloned into mammalian expression vector PRK5 with the addition of a 6-His tag at the C-terminus by methods known in the art, transiently transfected and expressed in HEK293 cells. Recombinant protein was purified from conditioned media using a Ni column.                Surface peptides of human and mouse PCSK9 were selected based on PCSK9 protein structure, and synthesized by Elim Biopharmaceuticals.                Example 7                PCSK9-Specific Antibodies as PCSK9 Antagonists                1. Identification of PCSK9-Specific Antagonist Antibodies                a. Identification of PCSK9-Blocking Antibodies                Murine antibodies to human and/or mouse PCSK9 were generated by immunizing mice with human-PCSK9 and mouse-PCSK9 synthetic peptides as prepared in Example 6 or recombinant proteins, and screening antibodies by ELISA assay using human and/or mouse PCSK9 recombinant protein as the antigens as described in Example 1 and other standard hybridoma procedures. Over 500 positive clones were obtained and allowed to grow to confluency in 6 well plates with 10 ml media. Media supernatant were collected and total IgGs in the conditioned media were purified using mAb Select (Pierce). The ability of purified and concentrated mouse IgGs to inhibit mouse and human PCSK9 function was tested in Huh7 cells using the methods described in Example 1. Hybridoma clones expressing IgGs that showed some degrees of blocking were expanded and retested. 60 promising clones were subcloned, expanded, and injected into either Balb/c or nude mice to produce ascites. Antibodies purified from ascites fluid were retested for their ability to inhibit the down regulation of LDLR by human or mouse PCSK9 in Huh7 cells. Four hybridoma clones, 4A5, 5A10, 6F6, and 7D4, were identified as being able to completely inhibit human PCSK9 function, and at least partially inhibit mouse PCSK9 function. To determine IC.sub.50 of each of these blocking antibodies, a serial dilution of IgGs were used in the assay, starting from 100 .mu.g/ml to 3.125 .mu.g/ml, with human and mouse PCSK9 concentration being constant at 6 .mu.g/ml.                b. Effect of PCSK9 Antagonists on PCSK9-LDLR Binding                PCSK9 has been shown to be co-localized with LDLR in cellular compartments (Lagace et al., 2006, J Clin Inv, 116(11):2995-3005. Recombinant PCSK9 protein also binds to LDLR extracellular domain in vitro (Fisher et al., 2007, JBC, 282(28):20502-12. To determine the relationship between inhibition of PCSK9 mediated down-regulation of LDLR and inhibition of PCSK9-LDLR binding by antibodies, we tested the PCSK9 antibodies that partially or completely blocked PCSK9 function on LDLR and representatives of antibodies that do not block. All partial antagonistic antibodies also partially inhibited LDLR extracellular domain binding to PCSK9, except one. Antagonistic antibodies that can completely block PCSK9 function, namely 4A5, 5A10, 6F6 and 7D4 also completely inhibited LDLR extracellular domain binding to PCSK9 (Table 5). 1050 values of these four antibodies correlates with their binding affinity to PCSK9.                c. Epitope Determination of the Blocking Antibodies                FIG. 4 illustrates the epitope binning of anti-PCSK9 antibodies. Part A) shows epitope information of anti-PCSK9 mAbs, determined by binding to synthetic 13-18-mer peptides or epitope binding via Biacore. Part B) shows the ability of immobilized antibodies 6F6, 5A10 and 4A5 to bind to human PCSK9 premixed with the mAbs indicated on the y axis by Biacore assay.                Another monoclonal anti-PCSK9 antibody, termed 6G7, binds to recombinant mouse PCSK9 but not human PCSK9. See Table 6. 6G7, 4A5, 5A10, 6F6, and 7D4 mutually exclude each other's binding to mouse PCSK9. Chimera analysis between mouse and human PCSK9 reveals that 6G7 binding to PCSK9 requires the catalytic domain. See Table 6. Thus the binding sites of 4A5, 5A10, 6F6, and 7D4 overlap the catalytic site and/or the epitope bound by 6G7.                TABLE-US-00007 TABLE 6 Recombinant protein 6G7 binding Human PCSK9 No Human pro + human catalytic + mouse C-term No Human pro + mouse catalytic + mouse C-term Yes Mouse pro + human catalytic + human C-term No Mouse Pro + mouse catalytic + human C-term Yes Mouse PCSK9 yes                d. Determining Sequences Species Specificity of Anti-PCSK9 Antibodies                To determine the species specificity of the anti-PCSK9 antibodies, antibodies were incubated with plasma from different species and the resultant complexes were purified and probed by an independent anti PCSK9 antibody on Western blots. The antibodies 4A5, 5A10, 6F6, and 7D4 recognized human, cynomolgus monkey, mouse, and rat PCSK9. See FIG. 5. Antibody 6G7 recognized only murine PCSK9 and an unrelated control antibody 42H7 did not recognize any tested PCSK9. Id.                e. Determining Sequences of Antagonist PCSK9 Antibodies                The amino acid sequences of the variable domains of PCSK9 antibodies 4A5, 5A10, 6F6, and 7D4 were determined using the method described in Example 5. The sequences indicate that the antibodies are related but different from each other. Table 1 shows the amino acid sequences of the variable regions of each antibody. Table 7 shows the CDR sequences of the light chains and heavy chains of Table 1 as identified by the Kabat and Chotia methods.

Anti-PCSK9 IgGs 4A5, 5A10 and 6F6 were amine coupled to the Biacore chip. hPCSK9 (100 nM) was mixed with 500 nM of 4A5, 5A10, 6F6 or 7D4 in various ratios and injected for 1 min at 10 .mu.l/min. The four antibodies mutually blocked one another irrespective of the assay orientation tested, suggesting that they all bind to competing epitopes. In contrast, they are able to form sandwich complexes with other non-fully-blocking antibodies that were mapped to specific regions using synthetic peptides.                2. Effect of PCSK9 Specific Antibodies as PCSK9 Antagonist in Vivo                a. PCSK9 Antagonist Antibodies Lower Serum Cholesterol in Mice                To determine if PCSK9 antagonist monoclonal antibodies can affect cholesterol levels in vivo by inhibiting the function of extracellular PCSK9, the effect of 7D4 was tested against mouse PCSK9 in vitro, on serum cholesterol when injected into mice. 6 to 7 week old male C57/bl6 mice were kept on a 12 hr light/dark cycle, bled to collect approximately 70 .mu.l serum on day -7. Antagonist PCSK9 antibody 7D4, and a control isotype matching monoclonal antibody were injected into male 7 week old C57/bl6 mice via i.p. injections on days 0, 1, 2, and 3. Mice were sacrificed on day 4 without fasting, and serum samples were collected. All frozen serum samples were sent to IDEXX laboratories for total cholesterol, triglyceride, HDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol measurements. FIG. 6 shows that 7D4 lowered serum cholesterol by 48%, while the control antibody did not have any significant affect. Both the amount and percentage of reduction are similar to what was reported for PCSK9-/- mice (PCSK9 knock-out mice), suggesting that one can achieve complete or near complete inhibition of PCSK9 function through blocking extracellular PCSK9 only, and that intracellular PCSK9 plays little or no role in down-regulating LDLR under normal physiological conditions. As expected, liver LDLR levels were induced in animals treated with 7D4 compared to those treated with a control antibody (FIG. 6).                b. A Partially Blocking Antibody Had No Effect on Blood Cholesterol Levels                FIG. 7 illustrates that a partial antagonist polyclonal anti-PCSK9 mAb CRN6 does not affect cholesterol levels in mice. Two groups of 8 week old C57/bl6 mice (n=10 mice/group) were bled and tested for cholesterol levels on day -7; dosed with 15 mg/kg/day of CRN6 or a control antibody by i.v. administration on days 0, 1, 2 and 3; and then bled and tested for cholesterol levels 24 hrs after the final dose. FIG. 7A shows that CRN6 antibody partially blocks PCSK9 mediated down regulation of LDLR in Huh7 cells in vitro. FIG. 7B shows that administration of CRN6 antibody does not affect serum cholesterol levels in mice.                c. Prolonged Effect on Serum Cholesterol by Antagonist PCSK9 mAb in Mice.                A time course study was performed to determine the time of onset and duration of the cholesterol lowering effect of PCSK9 antagonist antibodies in mice. MAb 7D4 or saline control were each injected i.v. at 10 mg/kg or 3 ml/kg in 48 6-week-old C57/bl6 mice. Eight mice from each treatment group were sacrificed on days 1, 2, 4, 7, 14 and 21 after injection. A single injection of 7D4 produced a fast and prolonged lowering effect on serum cholesterol. A 25% reduction in serum cholesterol was seen at 24 hrs after injection. See FIG. 8. Maximum drop of serum cholesterol was observed at the 7 day time point. At 21 days, the reduction in cholesterol is no longer statistically significant. Part B) shows HDL cholesterol. LDL cholesterol levels were very low.                FIG. 9 illustrates that the anti-PCSK9 antagonist mAb 7D4 dose dependently reduces serum total cholesterol, HDL, and LDL in mice. Six groups of 8 week old C57/bl6 mice (n=8/group) were bled and tested for basal cholesterol levels on day -7 and administered with the indicated doses of antibodies or saline on days 0, 1, 2, and 3 by i. p. bolus injection. Serum samples were collected and tested for cholesterol levels 24 hrs after the last dose. FIG. 9A shows total cholesterol levels, which decreased to less than 60% of control after administration of 3 to 30 mg/kg/day. The maximal effect on total cholesterol was seen at 10 mg/kg, and statistically significant reduction at 1 mg/kg. FIG. 9B shows HDL levels, which decreased to less than 70% after administration of 3 to 30 mg/kg/day. FIG. 9C shows LDL levels, which decreased to nearly zero at all tested doses of 0.3 mg/kg/day and above.                d. Dose Response of Antagonist Antibodies Specific to PCSK9 in Mice                FIG. 10 illustrates that anti-PCSK9 antagonist antibody 5A10 dose dependently lowers cholesterol levels in mice. FIG. 10A shows six groups of 8 week old C57/bl6 mice (n=8/group) to which were administered the indicated doses of antibodies or saline daily on days 0, 1, 2, and 3 by i.v. bolus injection. Serum samples were collected and tested for cholesterol levels 24 hrs after the last dose and showed a graduated decrease with increasing dose of antibody. FIG. 10B shows five groups of 8 week old C57/bl6 mice (n=8/group) to which were administered the indicated doses of antibodies or saline on day 0 by i. p. bolus injection. Serum samples were collected and tested for cholesterol levels on day 7 and also showed a graduated decrease with increasing doses of antibody.                FIG. 11 illustrates that anti-PCSK9 antagonist antibodies 4A5 and 6F6 lower cholesterol levels in mice in a dose-dependent fashion. Eight week old C57/bl6 mice (n=8/group) were administered the indicated doses of antibodies or saline on day 0 by i.p. bolus injection. Serum samples were collected and tested for cholesterol levels on day 7. In FIG. 11A, the antibody 4A5 showed a graduated decrease in total serum cholesterol with increasing dose of antibody. In FIG. 11B, the antibody 6F6 showed decrease in total serum cholesterol at 10 mg/kg/day.                Anti-PCSK9 antagonist antibodies 4A5, 5A10, 6F6 and 7D4 increase liver LDLR levels in mice as found by Western blot analysis. See FIG. 12. For 4A5, 5A10 and 6F6, 8 week old C57/bl6 mice were administered with 10 mg/kg of antibodies or saline on day 0 by i.v. bolus injection, animals were sacrificed on day 7, and whole liver lysate of 3 individual animals were analyzed for LDLR and GAPDH protein levels by Western. For 7D4, 8 week old Bl6/c57 mice were administered with 10 mg/kg of antibodies on days 0, 1, 2, and 3 via i. p. bolus injection, animals were sacrificed on day 4, and whole liver lysate of 3 individual animals were analyzed for LDLR and GAPDH protein levels by Western blot. All antibody-treated mice showed high levels of LDLR as compared to the PBS control mice.                FIG. 13 illustrates that anti-PCSK9 antagonist antibody has no effect in the LDLR-/- mouse. Eight week old LDLR-/- mice (LDLR KO mice) were administered 10 mg/kg 4A5 or saline on day 0 by i.p. bolus injection. Serum samples (from n=9-10 mice) were collected and tested for cholesterol levels on day 7. Administration of the antibody did not appreciably alter the levels of total serum cholesterol, HDL, or LDL.                FIG. 14 illustrates that multiple treatments of anti-PCSK9 antagonist antibodies in mice can substantially decrease total serum cholesterol. Eight week old C57/bl6 mice were administered the indicated doses of antibodies or PBS on days 0, 7, 14 and 21 by i.v. bolus injection. Serum samples (n=5-11 mice) were collected and tested for cholesterol levels on day 28.                Example 8                PCSK9 Antagonist Antibodies Lower Serum LDL in Non-human Primates                To test the in vivo effect of antibodies to PCSK9, antibody 7D4 was tested in cynomolgus monkeys. Four 3-4 year old cynomolgus monkey were injected with vehicle (PBS+0.01% Tween 20) on day 0, and 10 mg/kg 7D4 on day 7. Plasma lipid profiles were analyzed on days 0, 2, 7, 9, 11, 14, 21 and 28 following overnight fasting. A single injection of 10 mg/kg 7D4 produced a dramatic reduction in plasma LDL (60%) (FIG. 15A) and LDL particle numbers (FIG. 15D) in all 4 animals, while having minimal effect on their HDL levels (FIG. 15B) and HDL particle numbers (FIG. 15E). Total cholesterol (FIG. 15C) was also reduced following 7D4 treatment, while triglyceride level (FIG. 15F) was not significantly affected. Total 7D4 (G), and total PCSK9 levels (H) were also measured.                FIG. 16 illustrates the dose-response of anti-PCSK9 antibody 7D4 on serum cholesterol levels in the cynomolgus monkey. Two male and two female cynomolgus monkeys 3-5 years of age in each group were given the indicated dose of 7D4 on day 7 and an equal volume of saline on day 0 by i.v. bolus injection. Plasma samples were taken at indicated time points and plasma LDL levels were measured.                FIG. 17 illustrates a comparison of anti-PCSK9 antibodies 4A5, 5A10, 6F6 and 7D4 on serum cholesterol levels in the cynomolgus monkey. Two male and two female cynomolgus monkeys 3-6 years of age in each group were given 1 mg/kg of the indicated antibody on day 0 by i.v. bolus injection. Plasma samples were taken at indicated time points, plasma LDL levels were measured and normalized to that on day -2.                FIG. 18 illustrates the effect of anti-PCSK9 antagonist antibody 7D4 on plasma cholesterol levels of cynomolgus monkeys fed a 33.4% kcal fat diet supplemented with 0.1% cholesterol. Six 3-5 year old cynomolgus monkeys were put on high-fat diet for 16 weeks. Three monkeys were treated with 10 mg/kg 7D4 and three with saline on the indicated date. LDL levels of individual monkeys were measured and normalized to that of the treatment day.                Example 9                Humanized Anti-PCSK9 Antibody                The murine monoclonal antibody 5A10 was humanized and affinity matured to provide the L1L3 antibody. L1L3 has an affinity for murine PCSK9 of 200 pM and an affinity for human PCSK9 of 100 pM when measured by Biacore. L1L3 completely inhibits the PCSK9-mediated down regulation of LDLR in cultured Huh7 cells when incubated with 100 nM human or murine PCSK9 antibody. See FIG. 19.                FIG. 20 illustrates the dose-response of L1L3, mouse precursor 5A10, and negative control antibody 42H7 to block the binding of recombinant biotinylated human PCSK9 and mouse PCSK9 to immobilized recombinant LDLR extracellular domain in vitro. FIG. 20A shows human PCSK9 binding to human LDLR extracellular domain at pH 7.5. FIG. 20B shows human PCSK9 binding to human LDLR extracellular domain at pH 5.3. FIG. 20C shows mouse PCSK9 binding to human LDLR extracellular domain at pH 7.5. FIG. 20D shows mouse PCSK9 binding to human LDLR extracellular domain at pH 5.3.                FIG. 21 shows the effect on serum cholesterol of treatment with 10 mg/kg L1L3 in mice. Two groups (n=8/group) of 8 week old 057/bl6 mice were dosed with 10 mg/kg L1L3 or an equal volume of saline by i. p. injection on day O, Serum samples were collected and assayed for cholesterol levels on days 2, 4 and 7. L1L3 decreased total serum cholesterol by about 40% at days 2 and 4. In another study, when 10 mg/kg of L1L3 was administered as a single intraperitoneal (IP) dose to C57BL/6 mice fed a normal diet (n=10), serum cholesterol levels were reduced by 47% compared to saline treated controls, 4 days post treatment. When L1L3 was administered as a single IP dose at 0, 0.1, 1, 10 and 80 mg/kg (n=6/group) in a dose-response experiment in male Sprague-Dawley rats fed a normal diet, serum cholesterol levels were dose-dependently reduced, with maximum effect of 50% seen at 10 and 80 mg/kg, 48 hours post dosing. The duration of the cholesterol repression was also dose dependent, ranging from 1 to 21 days.                The amino acid sequence of L1L3 fully humanized heavy chain (SEQ ID NO:15) is shown in Table 8. The sequence of the variable region is underlined (SEQ ID NO: 54).

The change in serum HDL (FIG. 22A) and serum LDL (FIG. 22B) was measured from -2 to +28 days. Both antibodies resulted in greater than about 70% decrease in serum LDL levels by about seven days, an effect that substantially persisted for about six more days in the animals administered L1L3. All the animals showed normal liver and kidney function and near-normal hematocrits.                L1L3 dose-dependently reduced LDL-C, with a maximum effect observed in the mg/kg group, which maintained a 70% reduction in LDL-C levels until day 21 post-dosing, and fully recovered by day 31. HDL-C levels were not affected by L1L3 treatment in all dose groups. The animals in the 3 mg/kg dose group (n=4) were also given two additional IV doses of 3 mg/kg L1L3 on study days 42 and 56 (2-weeks apart). These two additional doses again lowered LDL-C and maintained LDL-C levels below 50% for 4 weeks. LDL-C levels returned to normal two weeks later. Serum HDL-C levels remained unchanged throughout the study.                The efficacy of L1L3 in non-human primates with hypercholesterolemia and pharmacodynamic interactions between L1L3 and HMG-CoA reductase inhibiting statins were investigated. Prior to the initiation of the study, the LDL-C levels of a cohort of cynomolgus monkeys (n=12) were elevated to an average of 120 mg/dL, compared to the normal average levels of 50 mg/dL, by feeding with a diet containing 35% fat (wt/wt) and 600 ppm cholesterol for over 18 months. Surprisingly, no effect was observed on serum total cholesterol or LDL-C levels after the daily administration of a medium-dose (10 mg/animal) of Crestor.RTM. (rosuvastatin calcium) for 6 weeks, and after a subsequent daily administration of high-dose (20 mg/kg) for 2 weeks. A single administration of 3 mg/kg L1L3 with Crestor.RTM. or vehicle treatment for 2 weeks, effectively lowered serum LDL-C levels by 56% by day 5 post treatment, and gradually recovered in 2.5 to 3 weeks while not affecting HDL-C levels. Upon switching the animals to daily administration of 50 mg/kg Zocor.RTM. (simvastatin), their LDL-C levels reached a maximal reduction of 43% at day 5, and stabilized thereafter. After 3 weeks of 50 mg/kg/day Zocor.RTM. administration, these animals were treated with a single dose of 3 mg/kg L1L3 while still receiving 50 mg/kg/day Zocor.RTM.. Administration of L1L3 resulted in another additional 65% reduction in LDL-C, in addition to the 43% reduction by Zocor.RTM., by day 5, and returned to pre-dosing levels within 2 weeks.                Other CDR amino acid substitutions were made to 5A10 in the course of humanization and affinity maturation and to achieve particular properties. The sequences of the modified CDRs and the PCSK9 binding abilities of the antibodies containing these modified CDRs are listed in FIGS. 24 A-G.
